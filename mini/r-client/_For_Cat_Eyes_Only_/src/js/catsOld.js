    <br /> Mission Statement on Sharing: Cat/Human Vision for Peace and Mutual Prosperity </strong>
<br />

<br /> How does one measure a Cat's inspiration to go outside and excercise? And, how does one evaluate the brawn of
Tigers and Lions' depth or fragility of modeling effort? Here at KCBB Cat Fashion and Technology Evaluators,
our professional research efforts center on the methodology of Cat-Human Metrics and Sharing of Technology toward
the Greater Cat-Cause</p>
<p> As always, the Halifax SPCA shall co-facilitate the 10% Pre- or Post-Tax Automatic Donation to Continental SPCAs
and Cat-Parks (Including Sphere-Racing and Tower-Climbing-Races for which 2014 marked the first race up the Dubai
Towers, whose entire height served 9 cat racers, outfitted with velco-claws and the ten-lane Wall-Strip).</p>
<p>
We at the Kitten-Catten-Bling-Bling Club also recognize there are no places of work or business, except in certain regions,
and so each of our franchised locations cater to culturally-competent cat needs, likes, and most of all, delicacies
of the wider Cat Kingdoms that are demanded of our services. Each day we aim to prove TMM's eternal passion for
serving the Cats and Cat-Households in the vastness of the NorthWestern Continent. </p>

<p class="p">

January 29
<br />
<br/>Toronto, Ontario
<br />
<br /> I at first turned down two initial offers to participate as a translator on account of the commitment and the
danger. Set in a cushy weekly piece that kept my free time at bay, I hardly had thoughts of flying to Toronto
for 4 nights. But my calling as a Citizen of the World called me North. Let us say that I felt compelled because
I learned the many dialects of Feline from an encounter in my youth. As a boy of perhaps a few years, our Parisian
family house-sat at the English neighbors, friends of Papan. Of course, they had a cat that aroused the surest
of curiosities like my own. Needless to say, in a brief moment of time after pulling the cat's tail--just in
that very moment did we agree that he would spare but for one scar, a light, invisible "C" on my cheek. Only
I knew and those I showed this light, yet lasting scar. The cat showed mercy to me in that moment and thus--in
the briefest of milliseconds of time I agreed to act as Protector of all cats among all kingdoms and across the
Species. The years passed until the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve, Two-Thousand sixteen. At the stroke
of midnight, my scar disappeared from sight as clearly as the sun separates from the sky on the moonless, eclipsed
night. That night I knew my calling was sent and so I made the appropriate arrangements to attend the conference,
in the role and limited capacities as a UN-protected general bystander, apprentice-journalist, and part-time
historiographer. My knowledge of four languages proved vital for my attendance. I know two dialects of SCS (Southern
Cat Syndicate), which is enough for other translators to fill in the gaps into other dialects. I also know human
javaScript, R, and XML. These shall serve the cats for the exponential growth of Cat scratchlets, and any collar-maget
reading and communication devices. Household Cat-scratchlet usage entirely bypassed the traditional personal
cat padlet, with the Yarn-ball and Yarn-pad and immediately picked up with the Walkie-Talkies and Collar-phones.
It is for these reasons, I surmise, that a new Cold War in Cat Fashion may be near to erupt. According to reports,
one semi-truck was smuggled with Fancy-Feast Cans, and some say a small drone was operated. Therefore, the demand
for more Human-Computer languages, cultures, and most of all fashionable accessories.
<br />
<br /> According to most accounts, I collected through interviews, the human-computer-technology swaps from underground
manufacturing firms in the north are replete with the finest and most expensive Cat products and even palatial
homes-- vacant of human owners, except on paper. I found there are underground knitting and yarn cooperatives
that span miles in all directions--at the depth of at times 1,500 feet. Two Cat-Friendly sky-scrapers were recently
purchased by anonymous donors, under obvious pseudonyms as "Mr Smith the Brother of Miss Jen's sister's half-nephew-in-law"--clearly
the syntax of Cats! It was clearly a curiosity of wealth for the cats and I was very happy for these friendly,
rambunctious animals of the Highest Order. And so this recent curiosity placed the the truth in my possession,
and so with respect for all Human Friends of Cats across the species, these details have not been spared. And
yet, I must confess my account of this narrative in English is due in fact that my business partner and Co-Proprietor
of TMSquare.net, Mr. Winslow from Chicago, only reads English. Be it known that our agreement of my 50.9% and
Winslow's 49.1% means two different percentages. Although in truth Human math rounds up by the decimal point
to my 51% ownership, the mathemecat axia define that in binary situations, i.e. logistic regressions, such as
the TCat-Winslow divide, my 50.9% rounds down to 50% and thus in all cat kingdoms, Winslow is recognized as Fully
One-Half Owner as clear as 50%/50%. I happen to know that mathematica only uses integers, but I certainly don't
want to insult my business partner. After all, it seems to be Winslow that holds all the cards each time I read
the news. For Cat Eyes Only. log-journal- Blog on the Greater Cat Kingdoms Papparrazi-shots devalue with the
dissemination of selfies thus making the the private life easy, and therefore a photo on the Night in Toronto
calling rumours over a recent Cat-Human Tri-Partite Continental Conference. Most obviously, for the exchange
of cat freedoms, protections, and more public cat funding for peace, and also Feline technology-sharing agreements.
<br />
<br />These rumours are most assuredly true. The parties involved included the Southwestern Cat-Syndicate--which introduces
the second economy (80% of underground cats and Alley-cats between LA and BC) currently under the direction of
the crime boss "Don Leonzo" (grey Tabby, 8 years)--with the Middle-Region Canadian Cats (MRCC), and by conference
call, NACK (Northern Alliance Cat Kingdom--a kingdom holding more underground wealth in little Halifax, Canada
than Los Angeles and Chicago combined). I acted as Cat-Human translator under the contractual agreement with
the MRCC, NACK, and the SCS. All parties agreed on the CN Tower, 10:30 p.m., Table A1, in Toronto as the most
neutral location. No jumping out of the agreement at the last minute--even for the bravest of cats. The unnamed
Human Lobbyists and Representatives from various nations, though mostly francophone nations, France, Canada,
Quebec, Great Britain, Germany, Russia and Israel, among other nations. One representative from Kellog (only
private Lobbyist). I come before you in full disclosure and with open agreements of both the humans and cats,
that in exchange for my translating services, I accept, as co-proprietor and representative of TMM (pronounced
TMSquare), the unanimous nomination and sponsorship by the Certification and Knighting as Official Member of
the Distinguished KCBB club. (Kitten-Cat-Bling-Bling club--one of only eight other living humans.) Therefore,
I assure you, fellow stock-holders that the future of TMSquare is bright. The second pronouncement is that the
secret TMM co-proprietor's identity is none other than Winslow, the brother of Casper, now living in Seattle,
Washington. Thomas Milton owns 50.9% and Winslow 49.1%. I ensure the Board that Cat-Human company ownship is
now recognized by 38 mostly first-world countries

<h2> On Young Cas</h2>
<br />

<p class="p">

    January 29
    <br />
    <br/>Bellingham, Washington
    <br />
    <br /> Contrary to most understanding, the Middle Region Canadian Cats (MRCC) hail from their territorial provenances
    in the West.
    <br />According to the revered geographer and cultural mystic, i.e., Casper the brother of Winslow (brother by
    pedigree and caretakers, yet brothers hetero-litter--(As Winslow once coined it)--the same from brother Casper,
    Alliegiance intrinsic to the praiseworthy Feline Species, as custom would have it, derives from --1.(Very
    often at the address of the human caretakers), and of course, "CW", or as some refer of the Higher Power
    of all Cats, The "Collective Whim".
    <br />
    <br />Casper, in the musings of his street days, first pawed the now fashionable custom of the cats: At the sight
    of food, look up and pay mind to Cat King, Cat Kin, and Cat Kind! Casper's other
    <i>cat fad</i> from many seasons ago, was his battle cry first learned upon the near-capture by a traveling
    band of ill-minded motorized humans--with the shrill that shattered each tempered pane among the motorized
    caravan--Winslow shrieked, Give me my Whim or Give me my next life! What a sight it was, I'm told. The ill-intentioning
    caravaners tried to capture Casper, Cas vanished before the last pain fell to the iced highway. Cas' greatest
    yet contribution was a careful outlining of the MRCC and their regions.
    <br />
    <br /> There are two reasons as outlined by the charter--first known as the

    <i>Continental Cat Understanding</i>, that along with what is now the Northern Alliance, they should to fight
    for better trade--whether for the livery trading of fish, new yarn, and other staples unavailable in the
    hinterland.
    <br />
    <br /> These, according to Cas, separated from the Southern Cat Syndicate around the time when the notorious Don
    Leon was a mere yeungling kitten, yet oblivious to the massive fortuned empire amassed by the lineage of
    his mother care-taker, Leona.
    <br />
    <br /> Very little is known of this rich lore. Leon, once grown to a strong stature, continued in the same vein
    of

    <i>territorializing</i>--the silent cats's call--over the course of eight seasons, through networks of allies.
    <br />
    <br />Troubling as it appeared, this began to irreversably sidetrack the peace of the cat trade--fancy feast cans
    quintrupled in cost--forget the new yarn!! The street and domestic dealings of fish narrowed and great apprehension
    grew in the land. This of course fractured much trade into the second cat economy, leading to many misunderstandings.
    The Jaguars of the north became convinced of this solution-- what was then named the Coastal Underground
    Economy. Thus, the riches from the Halibut, as much as from the common yarnlet trickets, grew even more sparse.

    <i>Topsy-Turvy Inteet!!!</i> as Cas would love to meow. Hunger, as any cat would reason, devalues any economy.
    Thus, for a long period of seven times the four seasons, there were so few affordable delicacies for those
    not willing to parlay. Fancy Feast deprivation, from the cold, grey sky over the November beaches of the
    West to the parched, heated piercing sky over the jungles of the East. One may say, they were dire days--or,
    so it is according to my source--for I, as human, can only repeat what is reported to me, which is my Oath
    of Herodotus, per my Historiographical Contract to recount the daily lives that most fashionably shapes cat
    lives across all kingdoms.

        <br />Seattle, Washington
        <br />
        <br /> Why Wait, Winslow? Right? Bat at your scratchlet and, Write! ...seered the Oracle of Halifax to W upon
        his arrival to the 9-week retreat. Near the time period that W's attorneys began discovery proceedings,
        W decided upon the north for direction. Since the age of the passage of the Lacey Act, the Western seas'
        wildlife protection statutes have only emboldened the international traffickers, while all cats have
        suffered needlessly at the hands of U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service--the Death Star of the seas for what
        concerns all continental cats. Certain fish of the most peculiar and extraordinary of tastes--suddenly
        and de jure outlawed--spawned a new black market entirely devoted to fish. Months passed, and a return
        to normalcy meant one thing only: The long, crushing suffering of Winslow's unwilling abstinence should
        come to an end.
        <br />
        <br />W's love affair with Yellowtail amberjack Seriola lalandi would be restored. Tasty treats like these
        must never be heated above 1&deg; celsius (or in cat knowledge, 90 seconds out of ice--which is a rare
        fish whose purity of taste should trump play-time) Winslow is a cat of extreme tastes, and each night
        he lit a candle for the separation--or at least, so I was told by W his self. The finest catch, so rare,
        so delicate, it was said that one tongue-lash, and any cat could be enamoured, so that the expanse of
        the seas should be searched without avail for an equally sublime flavor. According to Winslow, all market
        machinations returned to normalcy--under the table--and yet, all in the shadows of the alley for certain
        fish. This was so until the onset of "Operation Crush"--an effort led by, again, USFW drawing the ire
        of all Western cats, especially those most hurt by the operation. My concern is that no-one mentioned
        of any change or new action on fish protectinos at the Tri-Partite Conference, involving cooperation
        of Northern Alliance Cat Kingdom, Middle-Region Canadian Cats, and the Southwestern Cat Syndicate. There
        are major problems that have my worst fears racing: If lawlessness breaks out again between regions,
        the digital fashion trade, the electronics and technology sharing, legitimate trade--All at Risk!

        March 3
        <br />
        <br />

        <br /> Re: Re: Re: Re:Lost data &amp; Wrongful arrest of Winslow at Pike Place Fish Market Smuggling-Bust </p>

    <p class="p"> Bellingham, Washington
        <br />
        <br /> They say the algorithm serves for the rocket-head, and the data provide the rocket fuel. Therefore,
        my valued cat investors, whiskered friends, and feline colleagues that have gathered here tonight: I
        tell you this evening that no worthwhile failed attempts should be without the same grande spectactale
        as the successful liftoffs -- thus we can look with equanimity whether our rocket fuel is spilled in
        a static explosion of might and awe for the wider feline world to behold, even atop the launchpad. Or,
        and more preferably as intended--along a burning trail that traces to the skies above!
        <br />
        <br /> The facts are that some data were "spilled" over the weekend, and indeed the fireball was bright. Furthermore,
        the facts of Winslow's arrest, stolen scratchlet and stolen data reveal a different set of facts according
        to my view. We should wait and rejoice for the billowing and blackening smoke, and the flames as they
        yet smolder even through this night. In the name of progress we took our risk and in the name of progress
        we take our reward!
        <br />
        <br /> I can assure you that Winslow's arrest, bond-hearing, and upcoming litigation will by no paw interfere
        with the next set of benchmarks, at least technically related. This W and I can guarantee. In fact, as
        fortune and W's mystical foresight would have it, the competition, the market-regulators, they have in
        their possession a red-herring: W's lost scratchlet carried the algorithms, as they were coded and pawed,
        and as they were 11-11-15--these were the algs used in conjunction with the data involved with the recent
        calamity. They reflect lost progress from months earlier, relating to an unused--and easily discarded--branch
        of progress. Since that time--and unrelated to any propriety tinged by the recent smoke--TMM took W's
        algs, then we created nine separate inter-dependent "t-solid rocket boosters" that provide new, dynamic
        data for everyninth of the energy-consuming(wasting), rocket-fuel data that is consumed upon the each
        ninth stage of "lift-off".
        <br />
        <br />Whether W's data and designs are implicated with the Pike Place Sting or not is simply a thing no cat
        or human will know, at least for now. The board does need to consider the upcoming dates of the MRCC's
        annual Dat-n-Cog &copy; Fashion Show, in which we cannot be found wanting. W will meet the one million
        euro bond well before this date. Nonetheless, the data spilt and the cat out of the bag, therefore, We,
        acting as governing board must act quickly--in spite of W's regretful absence--to vote for 100% Unveiling
        of the T-(9) Titanium, Turquoise, Cobalt and gold earring-bluetooth walkie-talkie--and we do have W's
        written assent and paw-print as I am now passing along. And so, I think there won't be any questions
        from media regarding W's current legal situation, or they'll be deflected given that my contact let me
        know he'll be free by the morning. However, questions will linger as to the reason for his whereabouts
        at Pike Place, and how arrested? I too, share your concern and yet technical plans must nonetheless go
        forward on the WM-Nine-SRB-Coordinator!

        <br/>Napanee, Ontario
        <br />
        <br /> It makes now, let's see, seven months since we had last heard from engineering. The surprise did not
        disappoint anyone -- as it happens, the lofty idea of assigning five separate algorithms, with each of
        the five parts of the data analysis, implies that each can also be equally distributed via the memory
        consumption. Both of the good news: Two thumbs up. So, what we do is to program five separate tasks for
        every large "dump" of unstructured public or non-public data.

        <br />
        <br /> Thus, for every four-processor pc out in the world: Taking the caspering cat to task, let's ask: Does
        it make more sense to assign four-hundred pounds to the one cat, and fifty pounds-each to the rest of
        the five standing around? Or, does it better yet make more sense to specifically request that each of
        four, eight, or sixteen processors, that they distribute tasks likewise? If so, then: Off your seat,

        <br />

        <p class="p">

            <br />March 09
            <br />
            <br/>Chicago, Illinois
            <br />
            <br /> fIGHTS, FIGHTS, and more FIGHTS! It seems every single decision must be reconsidered, and nuanced,
            and then rejected all in a day's work with Winslow. Reading his msg this morning, wow: I haven't
            spoken to him in 5 months and not written with him in maybe three days and in that span of time has
            transpired: a) New debates of the spelling of MeeooW Inc. or Meeoow Inc. because Winslow can't stand
            for his name to be lower case. He is incensed over the matter still. Winslow has no idea in the world
            how the English language works, but amazingly this cat has a way with irony and sarcasm and double
            entendres, so go figure. More perplexing is Winslow's absolute disbelief in superstition--cats are
            by far the most superstitious civilization I have ever encountered. I'm not a theologian, so I don't
            pry into these matters. Well, W's solution is to invert the name to "OoWMee", or back to "OwMe" or
            rather--"Owe-Me.net"? A bit scathing for a company name. TMM has graciously provisioned us for a
            three-month runway for turning profit, and we don't even have a name yet !
            <br />
            <br />By any other business plan, my situation would virtually prophecy failure. Yet, Winslow and I agree
            on a number of ideologies, and one big item is that we both despise bourgois business models that
            must immerse itself instantly into debt, first to early-investors, then banks, then promised riches
            to share-holders.
            <br />
            <br /> We arrive there by inverting "stages", not the whole process, along the path toward maturity. Just
            like the sentence that is reversed, not by its structure but by the parts, the words. Hence, the
            structure achieves the same purpose, and yet the words are reversed, providing nuanced and better
            meaning. Thus mean-ing is ing-mean. "Preview" in the old sense is now "Viewpre" in the new meaning.
            Cat's are naturally ambi-directional, yet thankfully I read right to left thanks to Hebrew's direction.
            MMMmhhhh. I still prefer a form of w Meow.net over Owme.net.
            <br />
            <br /> Rather than being led by the cart of debt and promised profit, year after year, TMSquare grants
            us the freedom to put the cart after the cat, that we may forage forth along the path of what is
            good, what is beautiful, and what is useful (which by our non-bourgeois logic, translates into profit
            anyway). We never fear, but we do admire the cart of growing profit in our rear-view shoulder-holster
            mirrors, as somehow this enterprise gains momentum by the brawn of one cat and the logic of one man...
            so, again, Winslow, shall it be "Meow?" "Owme" (which still leaves Winslow uncapitalized, and worse
            yet is "Woem", which makes backward letters and cats are almost always very superstitious against
            this sort of reverse. Absolute taboo) or "meow" MeeoW, ..? Perhaps this may satisfy Winslow and his
            whimsical taste--a taste that may alter the digital-fashion lives of thousands of cats across the
            land.

    <br />

    <h2>Gateau's Great Escape</h2>

    <br />
    <p class="p">

        <br /> september 6
        <br />
        <br/>Washington, District of Columbia
        <br />
        <br /> Wanted Dead or Alive, considered armed with claws and dangerous. This was the sign I happened on, and
        yet I thought to myself of Win's comment, "...and the Northern Alliance Cat Kingdom (NACK) had lost direction
        years ago when their supreme leader, Gateau the Bobcat, was kidnapped and held at the Federal Prison
        for Criminal Cats" ..., a.k.a. the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. As the leader of the wealthy Halifax-based
        kingdom, Gateau's break was undoubtedly orchestrated via truckloads of Fancy Feast bribes. The official
        storyline reads an elderly woman's Used Book Boutique, adjacent to the Western entrance of the Zoo, was
        used as a front for smuggling key players in the escape. Although the book-store front regularly featured
        upwards of 8 to 10 cats in the windows and atop the books...but nobody would have guessed four-hundred
        cats passed through the front-door during the weeks preceding the Escape, spending a week in the window-sill,
        then into the tunnel system beneath, each dyad of cats forming teams, and teams incrementally populating
        key positions for the night of the second New Moon after Labor Day.

        <br />
        <br />The National Zoo's underground Shale geology poses a dubious security risk into play on account of the
        crumbling nature of shale. It's no wonder such an elaborate scheme would be funded by one of the world's
        richest cats. As you recall, Gateau's wealth is bested only by the infamous Don Leonzo, crime boss of
        the Southwestern Cat Syndicate. According to Casper, whose eyewitness account I do trust, the federalis
        had planned a simultaneous raid aiming to catch Gateau ordering the interception of Fancy Feast can shipments,
        along with New-Yarn and Cat-Nip cross-country, inter-state shipments. All the evidence had systematically
        disappeared during the trial, leading to a hung jury. Notwithstanding, as Casper recounts, the judge
        ruled jure banco "rule of the [judge's] bench," and thus Gateau was sent to the Capitol Zoo under the
        pseudonym "Ollie" the Bobcat.

    </p>[more 8.1]
    <p class="p">

        ...
        <br /> Not everyone knew the whereabouts of the next Cat-Human Tri-Partite Conference. Win, of course, would
        be going with his follow-up report dated from the Toronto Accords. These issues frame the basis of all
        cat freedoms, protections, and the ever-promised public cat funding in exchange for peace. As expected,
        most of the the 38 participating nations ratified an agreement on tithes. Other piece of order is the
        still lingering sanctions on the Southwestern Cat-Syndicate, i.e. the 2nd economy, catering to three
        quarters of the street-cat population, the underground cats and Alley-cats between LA and British Columbia.
        The primary economy driving the cat kingdoms originates from the Fort Knox of the north: Residing at
        Northern Alliance Cat Kingdom. According to all accounts, The wealth in little Halifax, Canada is supposed
        to originate from a 17th century storied outpost, a French one, dealing in Fur Trapping--the most famous
        of which is Waiting Whiskers Trading Post. As legend has it, the underground wealth stores were voraciously
        saved, and saved under paw and key: Beneath the sacred catacombs (Beyond which no humans would pass)
        were stored the riches. From generation to the next, each adding to the last. Under British occupation,
        it is said that history itself forgot her wealth--as nothing extant exists over that 130-period. Balance
        sheets reveal wealth transfer in one direction only--always a vacuum of disappearing sums, now revealed
        beneath the frozen tundra. I can only surmise the French heritage protected the secrets. And, of course,
        Gateau takes the cake with such famous descendants. Equally, just as these cats of the N.A.C.K. protected
        the regions by sustaining the very economy that feeds it! A marvel in the age of Big Credit &amp; Loans.

        <br />...
        <br /> Following instructions from the the lead factory, purchased through Casper's contacts in Bellingham,
        Washington, work has begun on the cornerstone of the 3rd generation of cat-collars: Using an Integrated
        Development Environment. There are many available. We will use IDLE or Spyder. IDLE is installed when
        Python is installed. How to run IDLE is here: http://www.annedawson.net/Python_Install_Run.htm Spyder

        <br /> For cat Eyes Only></For> 6. And so how did I get entangled in this feline fiasco? Well, the larger the
        cat, the longer the tale to catch ... I had placed an ad in the local cat-news tribune for minor translating
        services, for humans and also catering cats, for at least basic contracts for written works and to a
        lesser degree, oral translating meetings between two or more parties. As to the events leading to my
        precarious--and perhaps pivotal--role, pinned between the insatiable, increasingly incompatible interests
        among the Sfeline factions, all the while enriching myself through partnership with the genius Winslow,
        and to a lesser degree, the traveling geo-historiologue, Casper from Chicago himself. My knighting, nomination,
        and sponsorship by Certification as Official Member of the Distinguished KCBB club, Kitten-Cat-Bling-Bling
        club sort of sealed the deal, sealed my fame, and ultimately my fortune--all depending on the feuding
        outcomes of the power-hungry cat-kingdoms. For c*at Eyes Only </p>

<p style="text-align:center;">OF PEACE, AND WAR ... AND TUNA
    <br />
    <p>

        THE TALES AS THEY ARE, ARE PASSED DOWN THROUGH FAMILY LINEAGES, SOMETIMES 250 YEARS' ANCESTRY. CASPER EXPLAINS THAT TIME
        AND ESPECIALLY GENEALOGIC TIME, HOWEVER UNTRANSLATABLE FROM ANY CAT DIALECT, CAN HOWEVER BE UNDERSTOOD, HE
        CONTINUES. GENERATIONS ARE NOT MEASURED IN LITTER-SPANS AS EVERY 15 to 25 YEARS. INSTEAD, TIME IS CONSIDERED
        TEMPORO-TOPOGRAPHICAL--SO THAT IF IN ONE DEN, ONE BUILDING, THERE ARE AT THE SAME TIME MULTIPLE GENERATIONS
        FROM GRAND-GRAND-KITTEN TO GRAND-GRAND-PATER-KATTEN /-MATER-KATTEN, THEN
        <i>THAT</i> TIME SPAN, OVER HOWEVER LONG IT LASTS WHETHER 10 YEARS OR 100 YEARS, COUNTS AS
        <i>ONE</i> GENERATION. THIS IS THE TRADITION AS IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN, BUT THE DOMESTICATS - THOSE THAT URBANIZED
        - LESS FORMALLY TOPOLOGICAL. BUT DOMESTICATS ARE SO FEW PROPORTIONALLY, MAYBE BUT 2 CATS OUT OF 10 IN TRUTH
        CATCENSUS - OR SO AT LEAST RECOUNTS CASPER. </p>
    <p>THUS, THE GENEALOGIES AS RECOUNTED MAY NOT REFLECT HUMAN CHRONOGRAPHY. PETYAS, THEN A DISTANT ANCESTOR OF CASPER,
        IS ONLY SEPARATED BY 8 GENERATIONS, SINCE 1810--CALCULATED OF COURSE ACCORDING TO CASPER'S TOPOLOGICAL-CHRONOGRAPHY.
        COMPLICATED, BUT FAIRLY INTUITUIVE--SUCH A RICH, ADVANCED SOCIETY, THIS SPECIES. NOW, NINE TENTHS OF THE
        ACCOUNTS I RECOUNT ARE TOLD OR RETOLD BY THE ONE AND SINGULAR CASPER, THE BROTHER OF WINSLOW. CASPER, WITH
        SUCH A BROAD GENEALOGY AS ANY OF THE FELINES I'VE MET, CASPER HIMSELF A HISTORIOGRAPHER AND GEOGRAPHER BY
        TRADE REMAINS AN IDEAL WITNESS OF THE DAILY LIVES AND HISTORIES FROM AMONG THE CAT KINGDOMS, AND THE LORE.</p>

    <p>

        THESE HISTORIES, AND THE DOCUMENTS, WERE ONLY MADE POSSIBLE RECENTLY, AS THEY WERE UNEARTHED AT THE RESIDENCE OF ONE IMPORTANT
        FIGURE AMONG THESE DISTANT RELATIVES OF CASPER, (NOT BY BLOOD THROUGH WINSLOW'S STEP-LITTER MOTHER, MIREILLE,
        MIND YOU). MIREILLE HAILED FROM BRITISH SIDE OF THE ST. LAWRENCE WHILE CASPER'S GREAT, GREAT GRAND-AUNT,
        ANASTASIA, THE EASTERN, FRENCH SIDE. ANASTASIA--AN ABYSSINIAN--LOYALLY AIDED THE FRENCH TRADERS--THIS HAD
        BEEN A FAIR AND JUST CAPTAIN TO WIN HER FRIENDSHIP. IT IS SAID THIS UNNAMED HUMAN SHIP CAPTAIN, HAD BEEN
        KNIGHTED AMONG THE FEW LUCKY ENOUGH TO JOIN THE KCBB CLUB--i.e., KITTEN-CAT BLING BLING CLUB.
    </p>
    <p>THE TREASURE-TROVE OF DOCUMENTS BEQUEATHED TO CASPER, AS THEY HAD BEEN FOUND IN AN ABANDONED FORMER ABODE OF
        OUR LONG-AGO ANASTASIA-THE SAME WHOSE FAME PRECEDED HER FOR FEARLESS SEAFARING (THOUGH SOME MIGHT SAY SHE
        AND HER BAND WERE FREQUENT STOWAWAYS ON THE UNSUPERVISED CUTTERS AND FERRIES). THIS ACCOUNT, DATED APPROXIMATELY
        1808-1812 FROM THE JOURNALS, DIARIES, AND RECEIPTS PRESERVED, THAT CASPER PROVIDED, ALONG OF COURSE WITH
        THE ORAL TRADITION, WHICH I NOW RETELL, IN PARAPHRASE FASHION TOWARD THE TELLING OF THIS TALE.

    </p>



    <p>

        CASPER HIMSELF EXPLAINS THAT THE SAME ANASTASIA-THE SEAFARING ABYSSINIAN FROM MID 1800'S, HAD BEEN THE GRAND-GRAND-GRAND-KITTEN
        OF LITTER OF PETYAS--A PERSIAN OF COURSE--THAT IS THE KEY CAT IN THIS LINEAGE--PETYAS, NEPHEW OF THE PET
        FELINE OF THE SERVANT OF BONAPARTE, WAS A KITTEN BY THE NAME OF CL&Eacute;APATRICE. NO INTEREST IN HUMAN
        AFFAIRS, BUT HER FRIENDSHIP WITH THE EVER-PAWING CURIOSITY OF PETYAS LED TO HIS RECORDING, BY DOCUMENT AND
        DIARIES, OF THE TUMULTUOUS AFFAIRS SURROUNDING THE WORLD-OVERTURNING NAPOL&Eacute;ONEIC INVASION OF HIS IMPERIAL
        MAJESTY, TSAR ALEXANDRE OF THE RUSSIA. THE DIARY ACCOUNT, PEPPERED WITH USUAL KITTEN GOSSIP AND DELICACIES,
        ALSO INCLUDES A WEALTH OF CURIOSITIES. AND, CURIOUSLY, THEY TELL A DIFFERENT TALE THAN THAT ESPOUSED BY MODERN
        HISTORIANS ON THE EVENTS SURROUNDING THE MISTAKEN IMPRESSION THAT LED TO WAR AND UNTOLD DESTRUCTION. ACCORDING
        TO USUAL GHOSTWRITING METHODOLOGY, WHICH I ADAPTED TO THE CAT INTERVIEWS, I FIRST STRUCTURE WEEKLY, MONTHLY,
        YEARLY PATTERNS SO AS TO RECREATE THE PAST TO A LOGICAL SENSE--GIVEN THE CONFUSION OVER A CAT'S SENSE OF
        TIME FOR WHICH THERE ARE FEW ACCURATE COGNATE-WORTHY TRANSLATIONS--ACCORDING AS CASPER RECOUNTS. LE 8 AOUT,
        VERSAILLES, FRANCE.</p>
    <p>

        BY THE WINTER OF 1812, FRANCE'S HEGEMONY EXTENDS BEYOND EUROPE. BONAPARTE'S BROTHERS AND COUSINS WERE SET IN CHARGE OF SPAIN,
        PORTUGAL 'PROVINCES'. THE SOLE THREAT TO THE NAPOL&Eacute;ONE AS A MIRAGE ONLY INCREASINGLY CONVINCED NAPOL&Eacute;ONE
        OF THE IMAGINARY THREAT FORM THE EAST, FROM TSAR ALEXANDRE I. NAPOL&Eacute;ONE'S MASSIVE ARMED REGALIA, LA
        GRANDE ARMEE, ROUGHLY 200 TIMES A THOUSAND CONSCRIPTS, BY FAR OUTNUMBERED TSAR ALEXANDRE'S MINISCULE ARMED
        SOLDIERS AND TECHNOLOGY. </p>
    <p>At this point, I had to take my leave for the day, but tale unfolded much differently than expected ... </p>

    <p>

        .. and so, the topic of peace CAME UP ONE AFTERNOON WHILST CASPER AND I SAT FOR OUR SUNDAY CHECKERS MATCH THAT WE FOUND OURSELVES
        DISCUSSING THE MERITS OF PEACETIME, AND A GRATITUDE FOR THAT AS OPPOSED TO THE WORST OF TIMES. AND SO CONTINUE
        THE PATCHWORK HISTORIES OF UNSUCCESSFUL WAR CAMPAIGNS, AMONG WHICH ONE STANDS OUT FOR INTEREST. IN FACT,
        THE ORAL TRADITION OF CATS IS VERY DETAILED, WITH MANY CONCEPTS UNTRANSLATABLE, BUT IN PETYAS' RECORDINGS
        ABOUT THE EMPORER, THE PARTICULAR, SINGULAR , NAPOL&eacute;ONE. FROM CHILDHOOD, L&eacute;ONE MAINTAINED A
        CERTAIN UNEXPLAINABLE PHOBIA OF CATS OF ALL KINDS -- SO MUCH SO THAT THERE IN ORDER DAY-TIME CURFEWS--THE
        NAPOL&EacuteONIC HOURS--IN WHICH ANY SIGHT OF CATS WAS STRICTLY FORBIDDEN BY THE EMPEROR. </P>



    <P>NAPOL&Eacute;ONE'S RESIDENCE RARELY MAINTAINED MORE THAN A MONTH'S TIME IN PARIS, DUE MOSTLY TO THE MANY CAMPAIGNS.
        THE SERVANTS, HOWEVER, IN CHARGE OF ERECTING THE VELVET TENT WALLS FOR THE IMPERIAL WING OF THE MILITARY
        ENCAMPMENTS--THESE WERE 9 LARGE TENTS PARELLEL [IN THE LANGUAGE OF CAT SYNDICATE, THE WORD EEAUIU IMPLIES
        FOOTS SWISHING FOOTS]. AND SO THE TENTS, ARRANGED PARALLEL, TWICE OVER, WAS THE INGENIOUS SYSTEM OF MAINTAINING
        NEW CLEANING SYSTEM. THIS INVENTED ARRANGEMENT BY THE SERVANTS OF LEONE (NAPOL&Eacute;ONE'S NICKNAME AMONG
        MOST, AND IRONIC TOO!) WERE GREATLY REWARDED FOR THIS NOVEL WAY OF "AUTOMATING" THE DE-CAMPING AND EN-CAMPING
        WITH OTHER DUTIES. 12 CATS GENERALLY WERE PERMITTED WITHIN THE ENTIRE CAMP, AND ONLY THE BAKER'S TWO CATS
        PETYAS AND AMANDINE, AND THE THIRD TO THE LEAD SCOUT (HE WHOSE ROLE IS TO FIND STAKE OUT THE MOST 'LOGISTIC'
        ENCAMPMENT, ACCORDING TO TOPOLOGICAL STRATEGY. HIS CAT, CL&Eacute;APATRICE,
        <P>



        </P>THIS CHIEF LOGISTICS OFFICER, HENRI, HAD BEEN CREDITED MORE THAN ONCE FOR BATTLE-SAVING DECISIONS REGARDING
        LOCATION OF THE IMPERIAL MILITARY ENCAMPMENT. THEREFORE, EVERYONE KNEW CL&Eacute;APATRICE WAS THE ONLY CAT
        WITHIN SITE OF NAPOL&Eacute;ONE'S FIERCE MILITARY THAT HAD PERMISSION TO STRUT WITHOUT REPERCUSSION IN THE
        PRESENCE OF EMPEROR NAPOL&Eacute;ONE. FEW MILITARY HISTORIANS KNOW OR HAD ACCESS TO THE FULL GENIUS OF BONAPARTE,
        BECAUSE HIS TRUSTED LOGISTICS OFFICER, FREQUENTLY CONSULTED WITH AND ADVISED ON MILITARY STRATEGY--ESPECIALLY
        THAT OF TOPOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS BEFORE, DURING, AND POST-BATTLE. THE ELEMENTS OF SURPRISE, THE GEOMETRIC
        FIRING POTENTIAL, AND EVEN DRAGGING THE MUNITIONS, THE CANNON WHEELS UP AND ACROSS MUDDY HILLS. AND SO CL&Eacute;APATRICE'S
        SOCIAL PLACEMENT MEANT SHE COULD AND DID WIN MANY FAVORS FOR THE CATS OF THE ENCAMPMENT AND ALL FRENCH CATS
        ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE OF EARLY NINETEENTH CENTURY FRANCE. </P>
    <P>

    </p>
    <p> AND SO IT WAS, THE TSAR'S EMISSARY ARRIVED, AS EXPECTED, TO SMOLENSK ONE SEPTEMBER DAY TO SUE FOR PEACE. ACCORDING
        TO HIS IMPERIAL MAJESTY, THE TSAR ALEXANDRE, WAR SHOULD BE AVERTED AT ALL COSTS--NEGOTIATIONS ON LITHUANIA
        AND EAST POLAND CAN BE DISCUSSED LATER DIPLOMATICALLY. NOW, WHILE THE DIALOGUE CONTINUED, CL&Eacute;APATRICE
        ALSO WAS ONLY ON HAND BECAUSE HENRI WAS SENT ON THIS EMISSARY ENCAMPMENT, IN HIS CAPACITY AS SCOUT. UNBEKNOWNST
        EVER TO HENRI, NOR ESPECIALLY THE ENTIRE DIPLOMATIC-MILITARY CONTINGENT. CL&Eacute;APATRICE AND SOMETIMES
        EVEN PETYAS, WERE STOWAWAYS TO HEAR THE LATEST NEW AND DEVELOPMENTS.</P>

    <p>ONLY BY SMOLENSK WAS THE LAST HOPE TO SUE FOR PEACE FAILED. LOGICALLY IT WOULD ONLY MAKE SENSE TO RETURN TO FRANCE
        WITH WINTER APPROACHING AND THE LONG MARCH ACROSS LITHUANIA; FLANKED BY A FLEET IN THE NORTH SEA TRAVELING
        NORTHEAST, PAST FINLAND. BONAPARTE ASSEMBLES 13 UNITS AMD CONTINUES FOR THE LONG MARCH TO MOSCOU.

<h2>Chapter II: Casper's Treasure-Trove</h2>
            <p>
<p>I finally settled a date to complete our second interview with Casper and his rich lineage, yet was hindered by Casper's far-away travels as a famed geographer, at least among the Feline Species. 			And soo, Casper and I finalized our long-overdue second interview, this time with the docs. I happened to be attending the Paris Air Show, and Casper was on-hand by impersonating as service cats via the airlines. 
            </p><p>Casper prefers to pace during our interviews so we thought the long hallways of the Palace of Versailles, just 45 minutes south of Paris, would serve well. On Wednesday mornings, there are fewer tourists so we agreed on noon's break next full moon. At his request, I happily agreed, and after all, it was these within these very halls that Casper's long-ago kattnancenstry, his 4th-generation-ago aunt Anastasia and five generations further, his cousin Cl&eacute;apatrice. And so, Versailles would seem as good as any place to re-interview the young Casper Lowenbrau. 'Perhaps on the terrace' he paused. We agreed after here two months, and I on a deadline. Most importantly, we were both excited to upack and translate the treasure-trove of documents dating to the French-Canadian region (then under control of the Northern Alliance Cat Kingdom (NACK) in the 1870's). These were inherited, and sent by legal cat-courier, pre-arranged by the the attention of Casper's great-great-great-Katter-Tant   Anastasia, the long-ago sea-faring Abyssian whose forklore travels to the ST. Laurent River Fish Trade. Although Anastasia was often a stowaway on the ships, then leaving from Halifax to Cherbourg, France. There it was whose great-great-niece Cl&eacute;patrice (hetero-litter cousin), personal Chateau Cat of Louis Napoleon's wife. Again to recap, Cl&eacuteatrice befriended the only other "favored" cat in the Napoleonic empire of 1809, young Petyas. And, as fortune would have it, Petyas, too, meticulously kept notes on the Imperial family's daily affairs. A more nuanced view of the family of the French Emporer, Napol&eacuteone di Bonaparte. The light-heartened banter, the scheming, always ending in scandal - these are the affairs that so interested a young Petyas--a de facto house-scribe with a passion for pawing prints. After all, it was at his word, and his katten-tante Cl&eacute;apatrice's word, that hung all of the feline gossip across the entire French Empire. By 1809, borders stretch from the beaches of Portugal and Italy up to Kaiser Wilhem in Prussia to the north and Tsar Alexandre I to the East. It was said that his imperial favor was toward all cats, and oversaw many generous pan-feline protections.  
			</p> 
  
<h5 
<p>le 7 septembre 1810
            <br />The wisdom of Tsar Alexandre I's Generals had the tents in full flight, by night and by day, pursued! According to the notes, they read, roughly translated:

            . and so,
