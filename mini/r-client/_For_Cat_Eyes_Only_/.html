These documents, along the oral traditions passed down to my interviewee, Casper, the brother of Winslow 

                    </h2>

                 <p>

                     

AND SO IT HAPPENED ONE AFTERNOON WHILST CASPER AND I SAT FOR OUR SUNDAY CHECKERS GAME THAT WE FOUND OURSELVES DISCUSSING THE MERITS OF PEACETIME, AND A GRATITUDE FOR THAT AS OPPOSED TO THE WORST OF TIMES. AND SO CONTINUE THE PATCHWORK HISTORIES OF UNSUCCESSFUL WAR CAMPAIGNS, AMONG WHICH ONE STANDS OUT FOR INTEREST. THIS AND OTHER TALES ARE PASSED DOWN THROUGH FAMILY LINEAGES, SOMETIMES 250 YEARS' ANCESTRY. ALTHOUGH THE NINE TENTHS OF THE ACCOUNTS I RECOUNT ARE TOLD OR RETOLD BY THE ONE AND SINGULAR CASPER, THE BROTHER OF WINSLOW. CASPER, WITH SUCH A BROAD GENEALOGY AS ANY OF THE FELINES I'VE MET, CASPER HIMSELF A HISTORIOGRAPHER AND GEOGRAPHER BY TRADE REMAINS AN IDEAL WITNESS OF THE DAILY LIVES AND HISTORIES FROM AMONG THE CAT KINGDOMS, WITH ITS RICH LORE.</p><p>

THESE HISTORIES, AND THE DOCUMENTS, WERE ONLY MADE POSSIBLE RECENTLY, AS THEY WERE UNEARTHED AT THE RESIDENCE OF ONE IMPORTANT FIGURE AMONG THESE DISTANT RELATIVES OF CASPER, (NOT BY BLOOD THROUGH WINSLOW'S STEP-LITTER MOTHER, MIND YOU). ANA, HAILED FROM ALONG THE ST. LAWRENCE WHILE CASPER'S GREAT, GREAT GRAND-AUNT, ANASTASIA--AN ABYSSINIAN, LOYALLY AIDED THE FRENCH TRADERS--THIS HAD BEEN A FAIR AND JUST CAPTAIN TO WIN HER FRIENDSHIP. IT IS SAID THIS UNNAMED HUMAN SHIP CAPTAIN, HAD BEEN KNIGHTED AMONG THE FEW LUCKY ENOUGH TO JOIN THE KCBB CLUB--i.e., KITTEN-CAT BLING BLING CLUB. THE TREASURE-TROVE OF DOCUMENTS BEQUEATHED TO CASPER, AS THEY HAD BEEN FOUND IN AN ABANDONED FORMER ABODE OF OUR LONG-AGO ANASTASIA-THE SAME WHOSE FAME PRECEDED HER FOR FEARLESS SEAFARING (THOUGH SOME MIGHT SAY SHE AND HER BAND WERE FREQUENT STOWAWAYS ON THE UNSUPERVISED CUTTERS AND FERRIES) . THIS ACCOUNT, DATED APPROXIMATELY 1808-1812 FROM THE JOURNALS, DIARIES, AND RECEIPTS PRESERVED, THAT CASPER PROVIDED, ALONG OF COURSE WITH THE ORAL ACCOUNT, WHICH I NOW RETELL, IN PARAPHRASE FASHION TOWARD THE TELLING OF THIS TALE. 
</p><p>
CASPER HIMSELF EXPLAINS THAT THE SAME ANASTASIA-THE SEAFARING ABYSSINIAN FROM MID 1800'S, HAD BEEN THE GREAT-GREAT-GREAT GRANDDAUGHTER OF LITTER OF PETYAS--A PERSIAN OF COURSE--THAT IS THE KEY CAT IN THIS LINEAGE--PETYAS, NEPHEW OF THE PET FELINE OF THE SERVANT OF LOUIS BONAPARTE, WAS A KITTEN BY THE NAME OF CLEAPATRIQUE. NO INTEREST IN HUMAN AFFAIRS, BUT HER FRIENDSHIP WITH THE EVER-PAWING CURIOSITY OF PETYAS LED TO HIS RECORDING, BY DOCUMENT AND DIARIES, OF THE TUMULTUOUS AFFAIRS SURROUNDING THE WORLD-OVERTURNING NAPOLEONIC INVASION OF HIS IMPERIAL MAJESTY, TSAR ALEXANDRE OF THE RUSSIA.
THE DIARY ACCOUNT, PEPPERED WITH USUAL KITTEN GOSSIP AND DELICACIES, ALSO INCLUDES A WEALTH OF CURIOSITIES. AND, CURIOUSLY, THEY TELL A DIFFERENT TALE THAN THAT ESPOUSED BY MODERN HISTORIANS ON THE EVENTS SURROUNDING THE MISTAKEN IMPRESSION THAT LED TO WAR AND UNTOLD DESTRUCTION. ACCORDING TO USUAL GHOSTWRITING METHODOLOGY, WHICH I ADAPTED TO THE CAT INTERVIEWS, I FIRST STRUCTURE WEEKLY, MONTHLY, YEARLY PATTERNS SO AS TO RECREATE THE PAST TO A LOGICAL SENSE--GIVEN THE CONFUSION OVER A CAT'S SENSE OF TIME FOR WHICH THERE ARE FEW ACCURATE COGNATE-WORTHY TRANSLATIONS--ACCORDING AS CASPER RECOUNTS.
LE 8 AOUT, VERSAILLES, FRANCE.</p><p>
BY THE WINTER OF 1812, FRANCE'S HEGEMONY EXTENDS BEYOND EUROPE. BONAPARTE'S BROTHERS AND COUSINS WERE SET IN CHARGE OF SPAIN, PORTUGAL 'PROVINCES'. THE SOLE THREAT TO THE NAPOLEON AS A MIRAGE ONLY INCREASINGLY CONVINCED NAPOLEON OF THE IMAGINARY THREAT FORM THE EAST, FROM TSAR ALEXANDRE I. NAPOLEON'S MASSIVE ARMED REGALIA, LA GRANDE ARMEE, ROUGHLY 200 TIMES A THOUSAND CONSCRIPTS, BY FAR OUTNUMBERED TSAR ALEXANDRE'S MINISCULE ARMED SOLDIERS AND TECHNOLOGY. </p><p>ONLY BY SMOLENSK WAS THE LAST HOPE TO SUE FOR PEACE FAILED.  

LOGICALLY IT WOULD ONLY MAKE SENSE TO RETURN TO FRANCE WITH WINTER APPROACHING AND THE LONG MARCH ACROSS LITHUANIA; FLANKED BY A FLEET IN THE NORTH SEA TRAVELING NORTHEAST, PAST FINLAND. BONAPARTE ASSEMBLES 13 UNITS AMD CONTINUES FOR THE LONG MARCH TO MOSCOU.
