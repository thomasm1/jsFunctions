Set in a cushy weekly piece that kept my free time at bay, I hardly had thoughts of flying to Toronto\nfor 4 nights. But my calling as a Citizen of the World called me North. Let us say that I felt compelled because\nI learned the many dialects of Feline from an encounter in my youth. As a boy of perhaps a few years, our Parisian\nfamily house-sat at the English neighbors, friends of Papan. Of course, they had a cat that aroused the surest\nof curiosities like my own. Needless to say, in a brief moment of time after pulling the cat\'s tail--just in\nthat very moment did we agree that he would spare but for one scar, a light, invisible "C" on my cheek. Only\nI knew and those I showed this light, yet lasting scar. The cat showed mercy to me in that moment and thus--in\nthe briefest of milliseconds of time I agreed to act as Protector of all cats among all kingdoms and across the\nSpecies. The years passed until the stroke of midnight on New Year\'s Eve, Two-Thousand sixteen. At the stroke\nof midnight, my scar disappeared from sight as clearly as the sun separates from the sky on the moonless, eclipsed\nnight. That night I knew my calling was sent and so I made the appropriate arrangements to attend the conference,\nin the role and limited capacities as a UN-protected general bystander, apprentice-journalist, and part-time\nhistoriographer. My knowledge of four languages proved vital for my attendance. I know two dialects of SCS (Southern\nCat Syndicate), which is enough for other translators to fill in the gaps into other dialects. I also know human\njavaScript, R, and XML. These shall serve the cats for the exponential growth of Cat scratchlets, and any collar-maget\nreading and communication devices. Household Cat-scratchlet usage entirely bypassed the traditional personal\ncat padlet, with the Yarn-ball and Yarn-pad and immediately picked up with the Walkie-Talkies and Collar-phones.\nIt is for these reasons, I surmise, that a new Cold War in Cat Fashion may be near to erupt. According to reports,\none semi-truck was smuggled with Fancy-Feast Cans, and some say a small drone was operated. Therefore, the demand\nfor more Human-Computer languages, cultures, and most of all fashionable accessories.\n<br />\n<br /> According to most accounts, I collected through interviews, the human-computer-technology swaps from underground\nmanufacturing firms in the north are replete with the finest and most expensive Cat products and even palatial\nhomes-- vacant of human owners, except on paper. I found there are underground knitting and yarn cooperatives\nthat span miles in all directions--at the depth of at times 1,500 feet. Two Cat-Friendly sky-scrapers were recently\npurchased by anonymous donors, under obvious pseudonyms as "Mr Smith the Brother of Miss Jen\'s sister\'s half-nephew-in-law"--clearly\nthe syntax of Cats! It was clearly a curiosity of wealth for the cats and I was very happy for these friendly,\nrambunctious animals of the Highest Order. And so this recent curiosity placed the the truth in my possession,\nand so with respect for all Human Friends of Cats across the species, these details have not been spared. And\nyet, I must confess my account of this narrative in English is due in fact that my business partner and Co-Proprietor\nof TMSquare.net, Mr. Winslow from Chicago, only reads English. Be it known that our agreement of my 50.9% and\nWinslow\'s 49.1% means two different percentages. Although in truth Human math rounds up by the decimal point\nto my 51% ownership, the mathemecat axia define that in binary situations, i.e. logistic regressions, such as\nthe TCat-Winslow divide, my 50.9% rounds down to 50% and thus in all cat kingdoms, Winslow is recognized as Fully\nOne-Half Owner as clear as 50%/50%. I happen to know that mathematica only uses integers, but I certainly don\'t\nwant to insult my business partner. After all, it seems to be Winslow that holds all the cards each time I read\nthe news. For Cat Eyes Only. log-journal- Blog on the Greater Cat Kingdoms Papparrazi-shots devalue with the\ndissemination of selfies thus making the the private life easy, and therefore a photo on the Night in Toronto\ncalling rumours over a recent Cat-Human Tri-Partite Continental Conference. Most obviously, for the exchange\nof cat freedoms, protections, and more public cat funding for peace, and also Feline technology-sharing agreements.\n<br />\n<br />These rumours are most assuredly true. The parties involved included the Southwestern Cat-Syndicate--which introduces\nthe second economy (80% of underground cats and Alley-cats between LA and BC) currently under the direction of\nthe crime boss "Don Leonzo" (grey Tabby, 8 years)--with the Middle-Region Canadian Cats (MRCC), and by conference\ncall, NACK (Northern Alliance Cat Kingdom--a kingdom holding more underground wealth in little Halifax, Canada\nthan Los Angeles and Chicago combined). I acted as Cat-Human translator under the contractual agreement with\nthe MRCC, NACK, and the SCS. All parties agreed on the CN Tower, 10:30 p.m., Table A1, in Toronto as the most\nneutral location. No jumping out of the agreement at the last minute--even for the bravest of cats. The unnamed\nHuman Lobbyists and Representatives from various nations, though mostly francophone nations, France, Canada,\nQuebec, Great Britain, Germany, Russia and Israel, among other nations. One representative from Kellog (only\nprivate Lobbyist). I come before you in full disclosure and with open agreements of both the humans and cats,\nthat in exchange for my translating services, I accept, as co-proprietor and representative of TMM (pronounced\nTMSquare), the unanimous nomination and sponsorship by the Certification and Knighting as Official Member of\nthe Distinguished KCBB club. (Kitten-Cat-Bling-Bling club--one of only eight other living humans.) Therefore,\nI assure you, fellow stock-holders that the future of TMSquare is bright. The second pronouncement is that the\nsecret TMM co-proprietor\'s identity is none other than Winslow, the brother of Casper, now living in Seattle,\nWashington. Thomas Milton owns 50.9% and Winslow 49.1%.

Casper\'s other\n    <i>cat fad</i> from many seasons ago, was his battle cry first learned upon the near-capture by a traveling\n    band of ill-minded motorized humans--with the shrill that shattered each tempered pane among the motorized\n    caravan--Winslow shrieked, Give me my Whim or Give me my next life! What a sight it was, I\'m told. The ill-intentioning\n    caravaners tried to capture Casper, Cas vanished before the last pain fell to the iced highway. Cas\' greatest\n    yet contribution was a careful outlining of the MRCC and their regions.\n    <br />\n    <br /> There are two reasons as outlined by the charter--first known as the\n\n    <i>Continental Cat Understanding</i>, that along with what is now the Northern Alliance, they should to fight\n    for better trade--whether for the livery trading of fish, new yarn, and other staples unavailable in the\n    hinterland.\n    <br />\n    <br /> These, according to Cas, separated from the Southern Cat Syndicate around the time when the notorious Don\n    Leon was a mere yeungling kitten, yet oblivious to the massive fortuned empire amassed by the lineage of\n    his mother care-taker, Leona.\n    <br />\n    <br /> Very little is known of this rich lore. Leon, once grown to a strong stature, continued in the same vein\n    of\n\n    <i>territorializing</i>--the silent cats\'s call--over the course of eight seasons, through networks of allies.\n    <br />\n    <br />Troubling as it appeared, this began to irreversably sidetrack the peace of the cat trade--fancy feast cans\n    quintrupled in cost--forget the new yarn!! The street and domestic dealings of fish narrowed and great apprehension\n    grew in the land. This of course fractured much trade into the second cat economy, leading to many misunderstandings.\n    The Jaguars of the north became convinced of this solution-- what was then named the Coastal Underground\n    Economy. Thus, the riches from the Halibut, as much as from the common yarnlet trickets, grew even more sparse.\n\n    <i>Topsy-Turvy Inteet!!!</i> as Cas would love to meow. Hunger, as any cat would reason, devalues any economy.\n    Thus, for a long period of seven times the four seasons, there were so few affordable delicacies for those\n    not willing to parlay. Fancy Feast deprivation, from the cold, grey sky over the November beaches of the\n    West to the parched, heated piercing sky over the jungles of the East. One may say, they were dire days--or,\n    so it is according to my source--for I, as human, can only repeat what is reported to me, which is my Oath\n    of Herodotus, per my Historiographical Contract to recount the daily lives that most fashionably shapes cat\n    lives across all kingdoms.\n    <span class="excerpts">... more[1.1]</span>.\n    <br />\n\n    <br />\n\n    <hr>\n    <br />\n    <hr>\n    <br />\n\n    <h2>Chapter II</h2>\n\n    <br />\n\n    <h2>The Letters</h2>\n\n    <h3>More on Winslow\'s Accounting of Matters</h3>\n\n    <br />\n    <br />\n\n    <br />\n    <br /> February 23\n    <br />\n    <br /> Win bristles at the term lean ...\n    <span class="excerpts">more[2.1]</span>\n    </a>\n    <br />\n\n\n\n\n\n    <br />\n\n    <hr>\n\n    <br />\n\n    <hr>\n    <br />\n\n    <h2>Chapter III</h2>\n\n    <br />\n\n    <h2>Aux Chats Revue</h2>\n    <br />\n\n    <br />\n\n    <p class="p">\n\n        <br />March 09\n        <br />\n        <br />Seattle, Washington\n        <br />\n        <br /> Why Wait, Winslow?

Near the time period that W\'s attorneys began discovery proceedings,\n        W decided upon the north for direction. Since the age of the passage of the Lacey Act, the Western seas\'\n        wildlife protection statutes have only emboldened the international traffickers, while all cats have\n        suffered needlessly at the hands of U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service--the Death Star of the seas for what\n        concerns all continental cats. Certain fish of the most peculiar and extraordinary of tastes--suddenly\n        and de jure outlawed--spawned a new black market entirely devoted to fish. Months passed, and a return\n        to normalcy meant one thing only: The long, crushing suffering of Winslow\'s unwilling abstinence should\n        come to an end.\n        <br />\n        <br />W\'s love affair with Yellowtail amberjack Seriola lalandi would be restored. Tasty treats like these\n        must never be heated above 1&deg; celsius (or in cat knowledge, 90 seconds out of ice--which is a rare\n        fish whose purity of taste should trump play-time) Winslow is a cat of extreme tastes, and each night\n        he lit a candle for the separation--or at least, so I was told by W his self. The finest catch, so rare,\n        so delicate, it was said that one tongue-lash, and any cat could be enamoured, so that the expanse of\n        the seas should be searched without avail for an equally sublime flavor. According to Winslow, all market\n        machinations returned to normalcy--under the table--and yet, all in the shadows of the alley for certain\n        fish. This was so until the onset of "Operation Crush"--an effort led by, again, USFW drawing the ire\n        of all Western cats, especially those most hurt by the operation. My concern is that no-one mentioned\n        of any change or new action on fish protectinos at the Tri-Partite Conference, involving cooperation\n        of Northern Alliance Cat Kingdom, Middle-Region Canadian Cats, and the Southwestern Cat Syndicate. There\n        are major problems that have my worst fears racing: If lawlessness breaks out again between regions,\n        the digital fashion trade, the electronics and technology sharing, legitimate trade--All at Risk!\n        <br />\n        <br />\n\n\n\n    </p>\n\n    <h6>For Cat Eyes Only</h6>\n    <br />\n\n    <br />\n\n    <hr>\n\n    <br />\n\n    <hr>\n    <br />\n\n    <h2>Chapter IV</h2>\n\n    <br />\n\n    <h2>Re: Re: Re: Re:Lost data</h2>\n    <br />\n\n\n\n    <p class="p">\n\n        March 3\n        <br />\n        <br />\n\n        <br /> Re: Re: Re: Re:Lost data &amp; Wrongful arrest of Winslow at Pike Place Fish Market Smuggling-Bust </p>\n\n    <p class="p"> Bellingham, Washington\n        <br />\n        <br /> They say the algorithm serves for the rocket-head, and the data provide the rocket fuel. Therefore,\n        my valued cat investors, whiskered friends, and feline colleagues that have gathered here tonight: I\n        tell you this evening that no worthwhile failed attempts should be without the same grande spectactale\n        as the successful liftoffs -- thus we can look with equanimity whether our rocket fuel is spilled in\n        a static explosion of might and awe for the wider feline world to behold, even atop the launchpad. Or,\n        and more preferably as intended--along a burning trail that traces to the skies above!\n        <br />\n        <br /> The facts are that some data were "spilled" over the weekend, and indeed the fireball was bright. Furthermore,\n        the facts of Winslow\'s arrest, stolen scratchlet and stolen data reveal a different set of facts according\n        to my view. We should wait and rejoice for the billowing and blackening smoke, and the flames as they\n        yet smolder even through this night. In the name of progress we took our risk and in the name of progress\n        we take our reward!\n        <br />\n        <br /> I can assure you that Winslow\'s arrest, bond-hearing, and upcoming litigation will by no paw interfere\n        with the next set of benchmarks, at least technically related. This W and I can guarantee. In fact, as\n        fortune and W\'s mystical foresight would have it, the competition, the market-regulators, they have in\n        their possession a red-herring: W\'s lost scratchlet carried the algorithms, as they were coded and pawed,\n        and as they were 11-11-15--these were the algs used in conjunction with the data involved with the recent\n        calamity. They reflect lost progress from months earlier, relating to an unused--and easily discarded--branch\n        of progress. Since that time--and unrelated to any propriety tinged by the recent smoke--TMM took W\'s\n        algs, then we created nine separate inter-dependent "t-solid rocket boosters" that provide new, dynamic\n        data for everyninth of the energy-consuming(wasting), rocket-fuel data that is consumed upon the each\n        ninth stage of "lift-off".\n        <br />\n        <br />Whether W\'s data and designs are implicated with the Pike Place Sting or not is simply a thing no cat\n        or human will know, at least for now. The board does need to consider the upcoming dates of the MRCC\'s\n        annual Dat-n-Cog &copy; Fashion Show, in which we cannot be found wanting. W will meet the one million\n        euro bond well before this date. Nonetheless, the data spilt and the cat out of the bag, therefore, We,\n        acting as governing board must act quickly--in spite of W\'s regretful absence--to vote for 100% Unveiling\n        of the T-(9) Titanium, Turquoise, Cobalt and gold earring-bluetooth walkie-talkie--and we do have W\'s\n        written assent and paw-print as I am now passing along. And so, I think there won\'t be any questions\n        from media regarding W\'s current legal situation, or they\'ll be deflected given that my contact let me\n        know he\'ll be free by the morning. However, questions will linger as to the reason for his whereabouts\n        at Pike Place, and how arrested?

It seems every single decision must be reconsidered, and nuanced,\n            and then rejected all in a day\'s work with Winslow. Reading his msg this morning, wow: I haven\'t\n            spoken to him in 5 months and not written with him in maybe three days and in that span of time has\n            transpired: a) New debates of the spelling of MeeooW Inc. or Meeoow Inc. because Winslow can\'t stand\n            for his name to be lower case. He is incensed over the matter still. Winslow has no idea in the world\n            how the English language works, but amazingly this cat has a way with irony and sarcasm and double\n            entendres, so go figure. More perplexing is Winslow\'s absolute disbelief in superstition--cats are\n            by far the most superstitious civilization I have ever encountered. I\'m not a theologian, so I don\'t\n            pry into these matters. Well, W\'s solution is to invert the name to "OoWMee", or back to "OwMe" or\n            rather--"Owe-Me.net"? A bit scathing for a company name. TMM has graciously provisioned us for a\n            three-month runway for turning profit, and we don\'t even have a name yet !\n            <br />\n            <br />By any other business plan, my situation would virtually prophecy failure. Yet, Winslow and I agree\n            on a number of ideologies, and one big item is that we both despise bourgois business models that\n            must immerse itself instantly into debt, first to early-investors, then banks, then promised riches\n            to share-holders.\n            <br />\n            <br /> We arrive there by inverting "stages", not the whole process, along the path toward maturity. Just\n            like the sentence that is reversed, not by its structure but by the parts, the words. Hence, the\n            structure achieves the same purpose, and yet the words are reversed, providing nuanced and better\n            meaning. Thus mean-ing is ing-mean. "Preview" in the old sense is now "Viewpre" in the new meaning.\n            Cat\'s are naturally ambi-directional, yet thankfully I read right to left thanks to Hebrew\'s direction.\n            MMMmhhhh. I still prefer a form of w Meow.net over Owme.net.\n            <br />\n            <br /> Rather than being led by the cart of debt and promised profit, year after year, TMSquare grants\n            us the freedom to put the cart after the cat, that we may forage forth along the path of what is\n            good, what is beautiful, and what is useful (which by our non-bourgeois logic, translates into profit\n            anyway). We never fear, but we do admire the cart of growing profit in our rear-view shoulder-holster\n            mirrors, as somehow this enterprise gains momentum by the brawn of one cat and the logic of one man...\n            so, again, Winslow, shall it be "Meow?"

This was the sign I happened on, and\n        yet I thought to myself of Win\'s comment, "...and the Northern Alliance Cat Kingdom (NACK) had lost direction\n        years ago when their supreme leader, Gateau the Bobcat, was kidnapped and held at the Federal Prison\n        for Criminal Cats" ..., a.k.a. the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. As the leader of the wealthy Halifax-based\n        kingdom, Gateau\'s break was undoubtedly orchestrated via truckloads of Fancy Feast bribes. The official\n        storyline reads an elderly woman\'s Used Book Boutique, adjacent to the Western entrance of the Zoo, was\n        used as a front for smuggling key players in the escape. Although the book-store front regularly featured\n        upwards of 8 to 10 cats in the windows and atop the books...but nobody would have guessed four-hundred\n        cats passed through the front-door during the weeks preceding the Escape, spending a week in the window-sill,\n        then into the tunnel system beneath, each dyad of cats forming teams, and teams incrementally populating\n        key positions for the night of the second New Moon after Labor Day.\n\n        <br />\n        <br />The National Zoo\'s underground Shale geology poses a dubious security risk into play on account of the\n        crumbling nature of shale. It\'s no wonder such an elaborate scheme would be funded by one of the world\'s\n        richest cats. As you recall, Gateau\'s wealth is bested only by the infamous Don Leonzo, crime boss of\n        the Southwestern Cat Syndicate. According to Casper, whose eyewitness account I do trust, the federalis\n        had planned a simultaneous raid aiming to catch Gateau ordering the interception of Fancy Feast can shipments,\n        along with New-Yarn and Cat-Nip cross-country, inter-state shipments. All the evidence had systematically\n        disappeared during the trial, leading to a hung jury. Notwithstanding, as Casper recounts, the judge\n        ruled jure banco "rule of the [judge\'s] bench," and thus Gateau was sent to the Capitol Zoo under the\n        pseudonym "Ollie" the Bobcat.\n\n    </p>[more 8.1]\n    <p class="p">\n\n        ...\n        <br /> Not everyone knew the whereabouts of the next Cat-Human Tri-Partite Conference. Win, of course, would\n        be going with his follow-up report dated from the Toronto Accords. These issues frame the basis of all\n        cat freedoms, protections, and the ever-promised public cat funding in exchange for peace. As expected,\n        most of the the 38 participating nations ratified an agreement on tithes. Other piece of order is the\n        still lingering sanctions on the Southwestern Cat-Syndicate, i.e. the 2nd economy, catering to three\n        quarters of the street-cat population, the underground cats and Alley-cats between LA and British Columbia.\n        The primary economy driving the cat kingdoms originates from the Fort Knox of the north: Residing at\n        Northern Alliance Cat Kingdom. According to all accounts, The wealth in little Halifax, Canada is supposed\n        to originate from a 17th century storied outpost, a French one, dealing in Fur Trapping--the most famous\n        of which is Waiting Whiskers Trading Post. As legend has it, the underground wealth stores were voraciously\n        saved, and saved under paw and key: Beneath the sacred catacombs (Beyond which no humans would pass)\n        were stored the riches. From generation to the next, each adding to the last. Under British occupation,\n        it is said that history itself forgot her wealth--as nothing extant exists over that 130-period. Balance\n        sheets reveal wealth transfer in one direction only--always a vacuum of disappearing sums, now revealed\n        beneath the frozen tundra. I can only surmise the French heritage protected the secrets. And, of course,\n        Gateau takes the cake with such famous descendants. Equally, just as these cats of the N.A.C.K. protected\n        the regions by sustaining the very economy that feeds it! A marvel in the age of Big Credit &amp; Loans.\n\n        <br />...\n        <br /> Following instructions from the the lead factory, purchased through Casper\'s contacts in Bellingham,\n        Washington, work has begun on the cornerstone of the 3rd generation of cat-collars: Using an Integrated\n        Development Environment. There are many available. We will use IDLE or Spyder. IDLE is installed when\n        Python is installed.

And so how did I get entangled in this feline fiasco? Well, the larger the\n        cat, the longer the tale to catch ... I had placed an ad in the local cat-news tribune for minor translating\n        services, for humans and also catering cats, for at least basic contracts for written works and to a\n        lesser degree, oral translating meetings between two or more parties. As to the events leading to my\n        precarious--and perhaps pivotal--role, pinned between the insatiable, increasingly incompatible interests\n        among the Sfeline factions, all the while enriching myself through partnership with the genius Winslow,\n        and to a lesser degree, the traveling geo-historiologue, Casper from Chicago himself. My knighting, nomination,\n        and sponsorship by Certification as Official Member of the Distinguished KCBB club, Kitten-Cat-Bling-Bling\n        club sort of sealed the deal, sealed my fame, and ultimately my fortune--all depending on the feuding\n        outcomes of the power-hungry cat-kingdoms.

AND SO CONTINUE\n        THE PATCHWORK HISTORIES OF UNSUCCESSFUL WAR CAMPAIGNS, AMONG WHICH ONE STANDS OUT FOR INTEREST. IN FACT,\n        THE ORAL TRADITION OF CATS IS VERY DETAILED, WITH MANY CONCEPTS UNTRANSLATABLE, BUT IN PETYAS' RECORDINGS\n        ABOUT THE EMPORER, THE PARTICULAR, SINGULAR , NAPOL&eacute;ONE. FROM CHILDHOOD, L&eacute;ONE MAINTAINED A\n        CERTAIN UNEXPLAINABLE PHOBIA OF CATS OF ALL KINDS -- SO MUCH SO THAT THERE IN ORDER DAY-TIME CURFEWS--THE\n        NAPOL&EacuteONIC HOURS--IN WHICH ANY SIGHT OF CATS WAS STRICTLY FORBIDDEN BY THE EMPEROR. </P>\n\n\n\n    <P>NAPOL&Eacute;ONE'S RESIDENCE RARELY MAINTAINED MORE THAN A MONTH'S TIME IN PARIS, DUE MOSTLY TO THE MANY CAMPAIGNS.\n        THE SERVANTS, HOWEVER, IN CHARGE OF ERECTING THE VELVET TENT WALLS FOR THE IMPERIAL WING OF THE MILITARY\n        ENCAMPMENTS--THESE WERE 9 LARGE TENTS PARELLEL [IN THE LANGUAGE OF CAT SYNDICATE, THE WORD EEAUIU IMPLIES\n        FOOTS SWISHING FOOTS]. AND SO THE TENTS, ARRANGED PARALLEL, TWICE OVER, WAS THE INGENIOUS SYSTEM OF MAINTAINING\n        NEW CLEANING SYSTEM. THIS INVENTED ARRANGEMENT BY THE SERVANTS OF LEONE (NAPOL&Eacute;ONE'S NICKNAME AMONG\n        MOST, AND IRONIC TOO!) WERE GREATLY REWARDED FOR THIS NOVEL WAY OF \"AUTOMATING\" THE DE-CAMPING AND EN-CAMPING\n        WITH OTHER DUTIES. 12 CATS GENERALLY WERE PERMITTED WITHIN THE ENTIRE CAMP, AND ONLY THE BAKER'S TWO CATS\n        PETYAS AND AMANDINE, AND THE THIRD TO THE LEAD SCOUT (HE WHOSE ROLE IS TO FIND STAKE OUT THE MOST 'LOGISTIC'\n        ENCAMPMENT, ACCORDING TO TOPOLOGICAL STRATEGY.

THE ELEMENTS OF SURPRISE, THE GEOMETRIC\n        FIRING POTENTIAL, AND EVEN DRAGGING THE MUNITIONS, THE CANNON WHEELS UP AND ACROSS MUDDY HILLS.

NOW, WHILE THE DIALOGUE CONTINUED, CL&Eacute;APATRICE\n        ALSO WAS ONLY ON HAND BECAUSE HENRI WAS SENT ON THIS EMISSARY ENCAMPMENT, IN HIS CAPACITY AS SCOUT.

I happened to be attending the Paris Air Show, and Casper was on-hand by impersonating as service cats via the airlines. \n            </p><p>Casper prefers to pace during our interviews so we thought the long hallways of the Palace of Versailles, just 45 minutes south of Paris, would serve well. On Wednesday mornings, there are fewer tourists so we agreed on noon's break next full moon. At his request, I happily agreed, and after all, it was these within these very halls that Casper's long-ago kattnancenstry, his 4th-generation-ago aunt Anastasia and five generations further, his cousin Cl&eacute;apatrice. And so, Versailles would seem as good as any place to re-interview the young Casper Lowenbrau. 'Perhaps on the terrace' he paused. We agreed after here two months, and I on a deadline. Most importantly, we were both excited to upack and translate the treasure-trove of documents dating to the French-Canadian region (then under control of the Northern Alliance Cat Kingdom (NACK) in the 1870's). These were inherited, and sent by legal cat-courier, pre-arranged by the the attention of Casper's great-great-great-Katter-Tant   Anastasia, the long-ago sea-faring Abyssian whose forklore travels to the ST. Laurent River Fish Trade. Although Anastasia was often a stowaway on the ships, then leaving from Halifax to Cherbourg, France. There it was whose great-great-niece Cl&eacute;patrice (hetero-litter cousin), personal Chateau Cat of Louis Napoleon's wife. Again to recap, Cl&eacuteatrice befriended the only other \"favored\" cat in the Napoleonic empire of 1809, young Petyas. And, as fortune would have it, Petyas, too, meticulously kept notes on the Imperial family's daily affairs. A more nuanced view of the family of the French Emporer, Napol&eacuteone di Bonaparte. The light-heartened banter, the scheming, always ending in scandal - these are the affairs that so interested a young Petyas--a de facto house-scribe with a passion for pawing prints. After all, it was at his word, and his katten-tante Cl&eacute;apatrice's word, that hung all of the feline gossip across the entire French Empire. By 1809, borders stretch from the beaches of Portugal and Italy up to Kaiser Wilhem in Prussia to the north and Tsar Alexandre I to the East. It was said that his imperial favor was toward all cats, and oversaw many generous pan-feline protections.  \n\t\t\t</p> \n  \n<h5 \n<p>le 7 septembre 1810\n            <br /> then all the cats gathered and all knew L&eacute;one, and his antipathy against us cats. and so,\n            again, how did communicate this favor to Clea again?
