//     <p class="quote">When a lithium-ion battery is charging, lithium ions flow to the anode, which is typically made of a type of carbon called graphite. If you swap graphite for silicon, far more lithium ions can be stored in the anode, which increases the energy capacity of the battery. But packing all these lithium ions into the electrode causes it to swell like a balloon; in some cases, it can grow up to four times larger.
// <br /><br />
// The swollen anode can pulverize the nanoengineered silicon particles and rupture the protective barrier between the anode and the battery’s electrolyte, which ferries the lithium ions between the electrodes. Over time, crud builds up at the boundary between the anode and electrolyte. This both blocks the efficient transfer of lithium ions and takes many of the ions out of service. It quickly kills any performance improvements the silicon anode provided.
// <br /><br />
// One way out of this problem is to sprinkle small amounts of silicon oxide—better known as sand—throughout a graphite anode. This is what Tesla currently does with its batteries. Silicon oxide comes pre-puffed, so it reduces the stress on the anode from swelling during charging. But it also limits the amount of lithium that can be stored in the anode. Juicing a battery this way isn’t enough to produce double-digit performance gains, but it’s better than nothing.
// <br /><br />
// Cary Hayner, cofounder and CTO of NanoGraf, thinks it’s possible to get the best of silicon and graphite without the loss of energy capacity from silicon oxide. At NanoGraf, he and his colleagues are boosting the energy of carbon-silicon batteries by embedding silicon particles in graphene, graphite’s Nobel Prize-winning cousin. Their design uses a graphene matrix to give silicon room to swell and to protect the anode from damaging reactions with the electrolyte. Hayner says a graphene-silicon anode can increase the amount of energy in a lithium-ion battery by up to 30 percent.<sup>1</sup>

     Democratization of access to quantum software -- Cloud-backed hardware and open-software API's available to the public -- has been broadly expanded with Google Cloud Platform's March 6th White Paper, which outlines a package of (data analysis) simulation hardware, which "combines Cirq, an open source quantum circuit library, and the <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/quantum" target="_blank">TensorFlow</a> machine learning platform." In short, the complete package: 
    </p> 
    <p class="quote">Google today announced the launch of TensorFlow Quantum, bringing together machine learning and quantum computing initiatives at the company. The framework can construct quantum datasets, prototype hybrid quantum and classic machine learning models, support quantum circuit simulators, and train discriminative and generative quantum models.
    <sup>1 &nbsp; 2</sup>
    </p>
    <p>In my <a href="#12-22-18">12-22-18 blog post, Quantum Computing</a>, I wrote on IBM's pioneering efforts to provide public access to quantum hardware for limited use. IBM's <em>Q Experience</em> was the first to provide large-scale applications for public consumption, but those were test rides around a track while Google here is offering the track, the pit crew and unlimited supply of racing cars to work with and invent with, from under the hood to every tool in the shop. 
    <br /><br />
From the White Paper:
    </p>
    <p class="quote">
We introduce TensorFlow Quantum (TFQ), an open source library for the rapid prototyping of hybrid quantum-classical models for classical or quantum data. This framework offers high-level abstractions for the design and training of both discriminative and generative quantum models under TensorFlow and supports high-performance quantum circuit simulators. We provide an overview of the software architecture and building blocks through several examples and review the theory of hybrid quantum-classical neural networks. We illustrate TFQ functionalities via several basic applications including supervised learning for quantum classification, quantum control, and quantum approximate optimization. Moreover, we demonstrate how one can apply TFQ to tackle advanced quantum learning tasks including meta-learning, Hamiltonian learning, and sampling thermal states. We hope this framework provides the necessary tools for the quantum computing and machine learning research communities to explore models of both natural and artificial quantum systems, and ultimately discover new quantum algorithms which could potentially yield a quantum advantage.

    At a time when the national lines blur between multi-national corporations, and an interdependent global tech community, the 21st century space race is nonetheless well-defined -- however defined along the lines of sub-atomic inner-space.

    But just as the Soviet Union was the first to put both a satellite and a human being into orbit, before going on to lose the space race, China March be poised to outstrip any American achievements in a specific field of quantum technology — communication.<sup>1</sup>

    <p>
    But the goals are less abstract than sending a traveler to space; they define how national secrets can be securely stored, accessed and communicated: </p>

    <p class="quote">With Micius, Chinese researchers are attempting to use a different type of quantum technology to develop new forms of secure communications that would be unbreakable. Micius is being used to share cryptography keys, which are used to encode and decode secure communications.
<br /><br />
Ordinarily, these keys are vulnerable to interception, but Micius uses photons in a quantum-superposition state – it’s impossible to read them without changing what they say, so you can’t copy or intercept a key sent in this manner.<sup>2</sup>

<p class="firstparagraph">Data -- from the warehousing to the accessing and securing, all the while complying with data privacy regulations, has been a piecemeal, multi-faceted challenge: a race against the clock, against others' race against the clock, and of course the changing dynamics of the clock itself. If this sounds like an impossiblly rigged game, it is, because the goal posts bend for the best technologies availed by whom. </p>

<p class="quote"> Countries around the world are investing billions into quantum computing research. Mainly, it’s because it has applications in artificial intelligence. Security and the search for unbreakable encryption in AI-enabled applications that house personal, business, and government data are prompting the investment into this new research area.<sup>1</sup>

<p>The roadblocks for machine learning are clear: computing power for modern techniques are not sustainable in terms of insufficient memory and computing power, hence the current "A.I. Winter". In my <a href="#07-05-18">July 5th 2018 post, <em>Godfathers of A.I.</em></a> I outline the periods that technical limitations reduce progress and interest in A.I. applicibility. In preliminary advances, single-layered algorithms (think of one set of variables that drive prediction) and later iterations that involve multiple-layers that exponentially increase computing needs: 
</p>



<p class="quote">Programs that performed well in the laboratory were useless in everyday situations; a simple act like picking up a ball turned out to require an overwhelming number of computations. The research fell into the first of several “A.I. winters.” As Bostrom notes in his book, “Among academics and their funders, ‘A.I.’ became an unwanted epithet.”<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>So, then, what is at stake with the potential of quantum-based computations? Everything, because all the current machine learning roadblocks are flattened: </p>

<p class="quote">Quantum Computing also has the potential to allow AI to optimize its processing to such a degree that complex calculations needed to achieve artificial general intelligence can be carried out in record time.<sup>1</sup>

<p>This time it's more than a roll of the die and a few good hires. To the winner go the spoils, the losers work for the winners, and finally, not even time spent can predict the winners!</p>

<p class="firstparagraph">Gone are the days when the best and the brightest took home the honors and laurels. Today, an obsucre darkness rules over visibility into the advances that don't arise from obvious luck. Instead, networks of tech advances, some stolen, some spilled and some surmised from nothing form the new space race: The rocket head forms the algorithm and the expendible data form the solid rocket boosters. Period.

<p class="quote"> We need quantum-resistant algorithms as soon as possible,” Grobman said. 
Cloud computing is sweeping through the industry, and it will enable the use of quantum computing. And that’s a problem, as quantum computers may be able to break encryption techniques such as RSA encryption much faster than traditional computers can. Typically, encryption techniques make it easy to encode data but hugely difficult to decode it without the use of a special key. The security is possible only because of the huge amount of time it takes for a classical computer to do the computations. <sup>1</sup></p>
