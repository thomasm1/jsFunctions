The framework can construct quantum datasets, prototype hybrid quantum and classic machine learning models, support quantum circuit simulators, and train discriminative and generative quantum models.\n    <sup>1 &nbsp; 2</sup>\n    </p>\n    <p>In my <a href=\"#12-22-18\">12-22-18 blog post, Quantum Computing</a>, I wrote on IBM's pioneering efforts to provide public access to quantum hardware for limited use. IBM's <em>Q Experience</em> was the first to provide large-scale applications for public consumption, but those were test rides around a track while Google here is offering the track, the pit crew and unlimited supply of racing cars to work with and invent with, from under the hood to every tool in the shop. \n    <br /><br />\nFrom the White Paper:\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"quote\">\nWe introduce TensorFlow Quantum (TFQ), an open source library for the rapid prototyping of hybrid quantum-classical models for classical or quantum data. This framework offers high-level abstractions for the design and training of both discriminative and generative quantum models under TensorFlow and supports high-performance quantum circuit simulators. We provide an overview of the software architecture and building blocks through several examples and review the theory of hybrid quantum-classical neural networks. We illustrate TFQ functionalities via several basic applications including supervised learning for quantum classification, quantum control, and quantum approximate optimization. Moreover, we demonstrate how one can apply TFQ to tackle advanced quantum learning tasks including meta-learning, Hamiltonian learning, and sampling thermal states. We hope this framework provides the necessary tools for the quantum computing and machine learning research communities to explore models of both natural and artificial quantum systems, and ultimately discover new quantum algorithms which could potentially yield a quantum advantage.\n    <sup>3</sup>\n</p> \n   ",

If this sounds like an impossiblly rigged game, it is, because the goal posts bend for the best technologies availed by whom. </p>\n  <img src=\"dist/img/q-superposition.jpg\" width=\"400\"  class=\"zoom\" />\n<p class=\"quote\"> Countries around the world are investing billions into quantum computing research. Mainly, it’s because it has applications in artificial intelligence. Security and the search for unbreakable encryption in AI-enabled applications that house personal, business, and government data are prompting the investment into this new research area.<sup>1</sup>\n</p> \n\n<p>The roadblocks for machine learning are clear: computing power for modern techniques are not sustainable in terms of insufficient memory and computing power, hence the current \"A.I. Winter\". In my <a href=\"#07-05-18\">July 5th 2018 post, <em>Godfathers of A.I.</em></a> I outline the periods that technical limitations reduce progress and interest in A.I. applicibility. In preliminary advances, single-layered algorithms (think of one set of variables that drive prediction) and later iterations that involve multiple-layers that exponentially increase computing needs: \n</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"quote\">Programs that performed well in the laboratory were useless in everyday situations; a simple act like picking up a ball turned out to require an overwhelming number of computations. The research fell into the first of several “A.I. winters.” As Bostrom notes in his book, “Among academics and their funders, ‘A.I.’ became an unwanted epithet.”<sup>2</sup></p>\n<p>So, then, what is at stake with the potential of quantum-based computations? Everything, because all the current machine learning roadblocks are flattened: </p>\n\n<p class=\"quote\">Quantum Computing also has the potential to allow AI to optimize its processing to such a degree that complex calculations needed to achieve artificial general intelligence can be carried out in record time.<sup>1</sup>\n</p>\n\n<p>This time it's more than a roll of the die and a few good hires.

Today, an obsucre darkness rules over visibility into the advances that don't arise from obvious luck.

Period. \n</p>\n\n<p class=\"quote\"> We need quantum-resistant algorithms as soon as possible,” Grobman said. \nCloud computing is sweeping through the industry, and it will enable the use of quantum computing. And that’s a problem, as quantum computers may be able to break encryption techniques such as RSA encryption much faster than traditional computers can. Typically, encryption techniques make it easy to encode data but hugely difficult to decode it without the use of a special key. The security is possible only because of the huge amount of time it takes for a classical computer to do the computations. <sup>1</sup></p>  \n\n  ",
