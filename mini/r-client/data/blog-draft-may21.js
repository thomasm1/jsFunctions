Ethereum's Merge from Proof-of-work to Proof-of-stake is the big news, however the big liabilities such as gas transactioanal fees and throughput will not improve at all! Layer 2 solutions and side chains create an uncomforatable level of platform dependence. </p>   

  <p class="quote">Beiko was questioned by an individual about Ethereum miners who have been securing the network. The individual asked the Ethereum developer if miners would be “left out to dry.”
<br /><br >
  Beiko responded to the person and explained that he would not invest in any mining devices going forward. “I would strongly suggest not investing more in mining equipment at this point,” the Ethereum developer tweeted. Then the individual asked if developers planned the “plug pull” for June or if the ether mining community has more time. Beiko also replied to that question as well and said:

  It won’t be June, but likely in the few months after. No firm date yet, but we’re definitely in the final chapter of PoW on Ethereum.<sup>1</sup>

Winters" and processing limitations, one may overlook a more decisive approach to machine learning development, evolving from the what and how, to the why ...  however hard it is to extricate Hollywood's depictions of hope and fear from our minds!
  
  <br /><br /> 
  This 2021 Wired article's prescience on artificial intelligence is worth a read:  </p>   

  <p class="quote">
  More recently, techniques of machine learning have been used to gain an understanding from a database of successful proofs to generate more proofs. But although the proofs are new, they do not pass the test of exciting the mathematical mind. It’s the same for powerful algorithms, which can generate convincing short-form text, but are a long way from writing a novel.
<br/><br /> 
But in 2021 I think we will see – or at least be close to – an algorithm with the ability to write its first mathematical story. Storytelling through the written word is based on millions of years of human evolution, and it takes a human many years to reach the maturity to write a novel. But mathematics is a much younger evolutionary development. A person immersed in the mathematical world can reach maturity quite quickly, which is why one sees mathematical breakthroughs made by young minds.
<br/><br />
This is why I think that it won’t take long for an AI to understand the quality of the proofs we love and celebrate, before it too will be writing proofs. Perhaps, given its internal architecture, these may be mathematical theorems about networks – a subject that deserves its place on the shelves of the mathematical libraries we humans have been filling for centuries.

  <p>Yet another positive attribute of Tax is the power of attention.

  Crypto may have started out as a discreet decentralized economy, but now that the nearly $2 trillion sector has gone mainstream enough to occupy coveted Super Bowl ad space, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is well clued in.

The IRS classifies cryptocurrency as intangible property for tax purposes, which means the profits you make from selling virtual currency are subject to capital gains taxes. This holds true whether you bought bitcoin or altcoins on a crypto exchange like Coinbase, or simply used an app like Venmo or PayPal to buy and use cryptocurrency.
<br/><br />
  However exciting crypto may be, if you gave it as a gift, you should be aware of IRS rules on gifting. There’s a $15,000 gift threshold for 2021, meaning the giver doesn’t have to pay taxes on the gift as long as it's worth $14,999 or less. 
  If the value of the gift is over $15,000, the tax burden falls on the generous donor, who must file IRS form 709.<sup>1</sup>

  Instead of integrating CPU and GPU functionality (this combo is exceedingly slow), the overall theme of M1 changes centers on specialization of chips, id est, a digital instance of division of labor! 
  
  </p> 
  <p class="quote">
  M1 contains a wide variety of specialized chips:
  <ul>  <li>Central processing unit (CPU) — the “brains” of the SoC. Runs most of the code of the operating system and your apps.
  </li>
  <li>Graphics processing unit (GPU) — handles graphics-related tasks, such as visualizing an app’s user 
  interface and 2D/3D gaming.</li>
  <li>Image processing unit (ISP) — can be used to speed up common tasks done by image processing applications.</li>
  <li>Digital signal processor (DSP) — handles more mathematically intensive functions than a CPU. 
  Includes decompressing music files.</li>
  <li>Neural processing unit (NPU) — used in high-end smartphones to accelerate machine learning 
  (A.I.) tasks. These include voice recognition and camera processing.</li>
  <li>Video encoder/decoder — handles the power-efficient conversion of video files and formats.
  Secure Enclave — encryption, authentication, and security.</li>
  <li>Unified memory — allows the CPU, GPU, and other cores to quickly exchange information.</li>  
  </ul> 
  This is part of the reason why a lot of people working on images and video editing 
  with the M1 Macs are seeing such speed improvements. A lot of the tasks they do can run directly on specialized hardware. That is what allows a cheap M1 Mac Mini to encode a large video file without breaking a sweat 
  while an expensive iMac has all its fans going full blast and still cannot keep up.

  <p class="quote">Photoshop’s embrace of the GPU was made practical only through the 
  emergence of a common GPU software interface (called Open GL) that offered standard methods for using 
  GPUs across both Macintosh and Windows systems. OpenGL was at the heart of Photoshop’s first 3D features
   introduced over 10 years ago, first as a special benefit of ‘Photoshop Extended’, then later incorporated 
   into every Creative Cloud subscription for Photoshop.
  <br />  <br />
  Over time, increasing hardware capabilities and customizations have exceeded the limits of those original,
   cross-platform APIs, and now ‘native’ GPU APIs for Windows (Direct X) and Macintosh (Metal) offers better 
   stability and performance than the older generation of APIs.
  <br />  <br />
  With this transition to newer native APIs, together with the recent reboot of 3D tooling at Adobe featuring 
  the Substance line of 3D products, the time has come to retire Photoshop’s legacy 3D feature set

  <p>For now, Adobe's 3D Rendering is caught in the middle, but thank goodness for Adobe's work with Substance's 3D tooling...

    Data, unstructured and unrefined, serves little purpose for

  decade—programs that can beat humans at complex games, steer cars through 
  city streets under certain conditions, respond to spoken commands, and write 
  coherent text based on a short prompt. Writing in particular relies on recent advances in computers’ ability to parse and manipulate language.

  Those advances are largely the result of feeding the algorithms more text as 
  examples to learn from, and giving them more chips with which to digest it. And 
  that costs money.

  Consider OpenAI’s language model GPT-3, a large, mathematically simulated neural

  statistical patterns that predict, with striking coherence, which words 
  should follow others. Out of the box, GPT-3 is significantly better than 
  previous AI models at tasks such as answering questions, summarizing text, 
  and correcting grammatical errors. By one measure, it is 1,000 times more capable than its predecessor, GPT-2.

Whether markets or government institutios, it is the early adopters of Crypto technologie (and assets) will hold the higher ground. <br />Never one to shy away from new Technology, the land of the pioneering explorers has of recent turned Luddite, fearing change. Same as the cliff diver that 
   hesitates before a jump, only a rock and hard place are the new dreaded options.

  <p class="firstparagraph">Hex<sup>0</sup> white papers<sup>3</sup> reveal a seemingly ordinary DeFi Ethereum smart contract, 
  which by design is the first Certificate of Deposit. An interesting side-effect incentivizes hodling the Hex token, 
  rather than trading it or selling it, thereby dropping price. This behavior is by definition the single most effective factor on dictating a token's Market Cap value: More buyers (and hodlers) than sellers ...</p>
  <p>Therefore, Hex, ranked #3 in Market Cap<sup>1</sup>, is the only crypto that can drive up in value, but cannot drop in price ... without quickly being bought up: This is <i>because there will never be enough sellers to outmatch the widening base of Hex buyers, and of course the Hex staker-hodlers!</i>

  September is always a bad month for crypto. </p><p>More importantly, what drives the utility of the Ethereum Token is its irreducible requirement to run, operate, and transact any smart contracts on the Ethereum Virtual Machine, i.e., distributed, global Operating System.
  </p>
 <p>While Banks, Financial management, Hedge Funds, and the lot are busy buying into Smart Contracts, the only barrier to cross-chain leverage trading is the common
  denominator of real-time, global price updates: for which only a trusted 3rd party can triangulate common prices. For this reason, Chainlink's promise of continuing its hegemony over DeFi data sharing contracts. Chainlink will make this happen.

More importantly, interest in actual utility (smart contraacts and distributed ledger's utility in mediating real estate, titles, trusts, etc.) and applicability differentiates the current era.  </p>

  <p class="quote"><i>“In the near future, you may use blockchain technology to unlock your phone; buy a stock, house or fraction of a Ferrari; receive a dividend; borrow, loan or save money; or even pay for gas or pizza,” the report states.

  Along the way, Bank of America cites sizable figures—such as more than $17 billion worth of venture capital investments in digital assets and blockchain firms in the first half of 2021 alone, compared to $5.5 billion across all of 2020.
   </i><sup>1</sup> </p>
   <p>The article further outlines assets that outstrip the mere market value of the tokens themselves: After all, doesn't the value of a socio-economic disruption underlie the mere, simplistic value of the token's market cap? 
   Distributed <i>(decentralized)</i> Applications (DAPPs) represent a new means of accomplishing a formerly centralized task: i.e. government ID's, titles, etc.) </p>
   <p class="quote"><i> ... the report states that the “digital asset sector [is] too large to ignore,” and that there’s more to watch beyond Bitcoin. “We believe crypto-based digital assets could form an entirely new asset class,” the report reads. 
   “Bitcoin is important with a market value of ~$900 billion, but the digital asset ecosystem is so much more.” </i><sup>1</sup> </p>

<p class="firstparagraph">This year does feel reminiscingly like 4th quarter 2017 when Ethereum price jumped from 300's to 1400. Whatever the direction and timing Ethereum's price point in the 4th quarter, the utility of Ethereum\'s "gas" is the true value: Ethereum gas exclusively runs all Ethereum-based tokens (ERC-20) circulating as smart contracts on the Ethereum Virtual Machine. 
After all, any of the tokens on Ethereum network will always require Ether to transact, swap, send or any other smart contract function. This article covers the finer points of Ethereum's current value.<br />
<br />Technical Indicators<br />
1. Stochastic RSI - compares its closing price with the price range over a given period. (a reading above 80 is considered excessively bought and below 20 is considered excessively sold)<br />
2. Relative Strength Index (RSI) - measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions in the price of a stock or other asset. The RSI is displayed as an oscillator (a line graph that moves between two extremes) and can have a reading from 0 to 100.<br />
3. Bullish Hammer - candle that indicates the likely bottom of a trend. It is characterized by a long wick at the bottom with a short body on top. That shows that bears pushed the price down during the time frame, only to see significant buying pressure step in to close higher than the candle open. <br />
4. Fibonacci retracement level - Method for determining support and resistance levels. It is named after the Fibonacci sequence of numbers, whose ratios provide price levels to which markets tend to retrace a portion of a move, before a trend continues in the original direction.

<p>Doubtless, New Chain Lifecycle is 5% utility, 5% hype and 90% Decentralized App developers' community -- the ingredient <i>par excellence</i> for lasting hype and adoption. Here we have the exponential growth of Ethereum interest, let alone price of token. On the contrary we have Cardano Network, powered by Proof-of-Stake ADA token, which has yet to evolve past TestNet phase, a point of paralysis for Cardano chain DAPP development. One last step before final main net launch, and finally, we can witness David face Goliath...</p>

<p class="quote"><i>This year, we are seeing the direct competitors clashing. Ethereum has made great strides to make it scalable and affordable, with the Berlin fork already finalized and London hard fork scheduled for July.
In the meantime, Cardano smart contracts should be entering the Cardano testnet by the end of this month.</i><sup>1</sup> 
</p>
<p>Better late than never, the Cardano blockchain ecosystem boasts superior, more efficient, sophisticated smart contracting:</p>
<p class="quote">Cardano (ADA) is a highly anticipated direct competitor to Ethereum, promising more scalability and smart contracts with the Alonzo upgrade.</p>
<p>There are two obstinate problems:<i>Ethereum's monopolistic and universal DAPP evolution and ADA's stunted community development.</i></p>
<p>First, All customized business applications, whether off-chain or on-, have built architectures depending on private/consortium blockchains that periodically sync with Ethereum mainnet. </p><p>Secondly, whether or not Cardono does launch main net, the multi-year delay in even <i>launching</i>chain mainnet --for all its bells and whistles -- has stunted new development and developer solidarity. Despite the author's praise for ADA, he concedes the infinitesimally small likelihood that Cardano developers will ever approach Ethereum network --</p> 
<p class="quote">Lastly, despite getting up to 7th rank, Cardano (ADA) is not likely to catch up with Ethereum’s much larger dev pool and network effect.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>And so, beyond Ethereum 2's Proof-of-Stake transition on the near horizon, ethereum enjoys a burgeoning ecosystem of layer-2 sidechains, facilitated by the likes of those as Polygon (Matic) solutions. Even so, next to Polkadot ecosystem, only Cardano stands as a viable challenge, how ever miniscule it may be...</p>
<p class="quote">
*Ethereum holds (by far) the largest pool of developers, according to Electric Capital. As a number of open source dev ops tools are available to make remote work easier through collaboration, managing developers remains a serious cog in DeFi development. Yet Ethereum and its developer community have thus far been dominant in this sense.<br /><br />
*In the last three years, Ethereum has widened its developer pool by 215%. Such a network effect would be exceedingly difficult to overcome.</i><sup>2</sup>
