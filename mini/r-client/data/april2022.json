The individual asked the Ethereum developer if miners would be “left out to dry.”\n<br /><br >\n  Beiko responded to the person and explained that he would not invest in any mining devices going forward. “I would strongly suggest not investing more in mining equipment at this point,” the Ethereum developer tweeted. Then the individual asked if developers planned the “plug pull” for June or if the ether mining community has more time. Beiko also replied to that question as well and said:\n  <br /><br >\n  It won’t be June, but likely in the few months after.

Writing in particular relies on recent advances in computers’ ability to parse and manipulate language.\n  <br /><br />\n  Those advances are largely the result of feeding the algorithms more text as \n  examples to learn from, and giving them more chips with which to digest it. And \n  that costs money.\n  <br /><br />\n  Consider OpenAI’s language model GPT-3, a large, mathematically simulated neural \n  network that was fed reams of text scraped from the web. GPT-3 can find \n  statistical patterns that predict, with striking coherence, which words \n  should follow others. Out of the box, GPT-3 is significantly better than \n  previous AI models at tasks such as answering questions, summarizing text, \n  and correcting grammatical errors. By one measure, it is 1,000 times more capable than its predecessor, GPT-2. \n  But training GPT-3 cost, by some estimates, almost $5 million.<sup>1</sup></p>\n",
