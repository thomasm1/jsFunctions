Since Web Assembly only recognizes two floating point number types and two integer types, Rust handles string values, etc.</p> <p class="quote"><i>Both Rust and JavaScript have vibrant package ecosystems. Rust has cargo and crates.io. JavaScript has several CLI tools, including the npm CLI, that interface with the npm registry.

  Rust developers should be able to produce WebAssembly packages for use in JavaScript without requiring a Node.js development environment
  JavaScript developers should be able to use WebAssembly without requiring a Rust development environment

Enter: wasm-pack. 
wasm-pack is a tool for assembling and packaging Rust crates that target WebAssembly. These packages can be published to the npm Registry and used alongside other packages. This means you can use them side-by-side with JS and other packages, and in many kind of applications, be it a Node.js server side app, a client-side application bundled by Webpack, or any other sort of application that uses npm dependencies. You can find wasm-pack on crates.io and GitHub.<sup>1 </sup></p>

Data visualization software is prohibitively expensive, and complicated, limiting access to universities and commerce. So, many important data stories are relegated to Excel bar charts. These days, the preeminent medium for graphical representation of data is free to all: <i><strong>Pandas</strong>, short for the  Econometrics term 'Panel Data', that features paragraphs of statistical, programming language with spoken language, coupled with powerful data visualization:  </i> </p>
    <p class="quote">
    Millions of people around the world use Pandas. In October 2017 alone, Stack Overflow, a website for programmers, recorded 5 million visits to questions about Pandas from more than 1 million unique visitors. Data scientists at Google, Facebook, JP Morgan, and virtually every other major company that analyze data uses Pandas. Most people haven’t heard of it, but for many people who do heavy data analysis—a rapidly growing group these days—life wouldn’t be the same without it. (Pandas is open source, so it’s free to use.)  <br /><br />Basically, Pandas makes it so that data analysis tasks that would have taken 50 complex lines of code in the past now only take 5 simple lines, because  [Pandas creator] McKinney already did the heavy lifting.

  <p class="firstparagraph">The College Term-Paper, the perennial object of dread or elation, of tedium or excitement. Yet, more and more, the needs for communication require the inclusion of programming, analytic language. Paragraphs of eloquently written code with paragraphs of synopsis, from one logical statement to the next, laying out the proofs with each paragraph. Best yet, it is innately online and presentable, and employs the powerful languages like Python and R. But how to communicate these specialized papers to a wide audience?</p>
    <p class="quote"> 
    The more sophisticated science becomes, the harder it is to communicate results. Papers today are longer than ever and full of jargon and symbols. They depend on chains of computer programs that generate data, and clean up data, and plot data, and run statistical models on data. These programs tend to be both so sloppily written and so central to the results that it’s contributed to a replication crisis, or put another way, a failure of the paper to perform its most basic task: to report what you’ve actually discovered, clearly enough that someone else can discover it for themselves.<br /><br />
    Perhaps the paper itself is to blame. Scientific methods evolve now at the speed of software; the skill most in demand among physicists, biologists, chemists, geologists, even anthropologists and research psychologists, is facility with programming languages and “data science” packages. And yet the basic means of communicating scientific results hasn’t changed for 400 years. Papers may be posted online, but they’re still text and pictures on a page.<sup>1</sup></p>

  Earlier  Statisticians and Scientists, i.e. modern Developers and Engineers also took their generation's Information Technology, applying it toward human-driven purposes. </p>
  <p>I'm an optimist at heart, so this blog post stands out: </p><p class="quote">I’d like to point out that the recipe isn’t all that different from code that a programmer might have written by eyeballing the problem and manually making up some rules. Quit anthropomorphizing machine learning already. A model is conceptually the same kind of thing as regular code. You know, the kind of recipe that’s handcrafted by some human armed with an opinion and a caffeine source.<br /><br />And don’t go around saying that retraining — jargon for rerunning the algorithm to adjust the boundary as new examples are gathered — makes it creature-like or inherently different from your programmer’s standard work product. Humans can sit there tweaking the code in response to new info too. <sup>1</sup>

  <p> Now, A.I. that is attached to robototics? That is an entirely different story, and more akin to another technology, gun weapon proliferation and advancement.

The crypto-phenomenon moreso resembles the derivatives packages from the 2007-8 recession bust because value was placed on real estate's miscalculated worth based on the assumption the homeowners didn't borrow over their income. Likewise crypto-ICO's values wasn't based on a currency comprised of real cash, but <i> rather, ICO's and crypto-platforms were investments of crypto-currency!</i>So, if the one does well, the other continues to do well, multiplied. But exponential gain also means logarithmic loss ...
   <p class="quote"> There has been a collapse in the number of ICOs that have tried to raise financing.

  This has been driven by a number of factors including uncertainty around regulation, falling crypto market prices and of course, disillusionment in the previous ICOs that raised funding.    Given that the Ethereum blockchain was the premier platform for ICOs to raise their funding, it is feeling the brunt of this slowdown.<br /><br />
  
  Not only is this lack of “ICO demand” for ETH having an adverse effect on the price but the previous ICOs are also driving the price lower as they try to convert their ETH into Fiat currency to meet expenses.<sup>1</sup>  </p>
  <p>Notwithstanding, <i> We can also are miscalculating about crypto-platforms'   center of value  ... it's   about the upcoming actual and inevitable practicality for everyday uses.</i> So, three cheers to a long, slow ramp--to another  great  and lasting crypto-currency resurgence!</p>.0

  <p class="quote"> The recent report examines the practices of ten crypto trading platforms based in the U.S. and abroad, as well data collected by the Attorney General’s office about the state of digital currency markets as a whole.<br /><br />

  The study found that the absence of accepted methods for auditing virtual assets results in the lack of a consistent and transparent approach to independently auditing digital currency traded on exchanges. This puts customers’ funds held on their exchange accounts at risk of attacks from hackers or theft. The report subsequently questions the issue of public protection and the sufficiency of the commercial insurance to cover possible losses.<br /><br />
  
  The report further outlines abusive trading practices, emphasizing that the majority of crypto trading platforms deploy automated traders, offering them special conditions, which leaves retail customers at a disadvantage. It also states that digital currency exchanges involve numerous, overlapping lines of business that represent serious conflicts of interest. The report explains:
  <br /><br />
  “Automated trading activities could also allow a single trader or group of traders to command multiple accounts simultaneously to obscure coordinated trading, in order to manipulate prices.”<sup>1</sup>

Paris' smog-dispelling culture presents itself as <i>The City at the center of action</i> with respect to global, macro-level problems. Why the city? It only makes sense that collective action and mobilization requires the correct ratio of community leaders and actors to engage enough social momentum to overcome apathy. </p>
  <p class="quote">This year, the ban on motorized traffic will apply to the whole of Paris, except for the Bois (woods) and the périphérique (inner ring road). 
  The Parisians themselves will not be able to drive their own vehicle, including electric vehicles, 'clean' energy vehicles, and Autolib vehicles.<br /><br />
  
  The following vehicles will be allowed to circulate, at a maximum of 30 km/h: non-motorized vehicles, emergency vehicles, vehicles for disabled people, taxis, public transport, BigBus and Open Tour, and VTC (the latter (private hire taxis) were not allowed to circulate last year). There are also numerous alternative modes of transport - bicycle, horse & carriage, cyclopolitain (pedicabs) … <sup>1</sup>

    <p>On a national-level, action is highly effective but practically impossible, while the community-level can hardly muster the type of leverage to influence other communities. <i> The city, often composed of multiple millions and spanning larger geographies, resembles the powerful cities that governed nation-states from the middle ages forward.</i> Examples include 16th century Florence, 17th century Istanbul, 18th century Paris, and 19th century London--not to mention the first global city-state power, Rome.

The kinds of folks with noble pursuits. This was climate change activism without borders. If the Paris Agreement, drafted in 2015, was about governments coming together to fight, last week’s event showed that the most ambitious climate action isn’t happening on the national scale—it’s cities and states that are leading the way.<sup>2</sup></p>

  <p class="quote">
  On Wednesday Apple announced that the neural engine is now significantly more powerful. Last year’s debut model could crank through 600 billion operations per second. The new version can work almost 10 times faster, reaching 5 trillion operations per second. Some of that speedup may come from using smaller transistors inside the A12, with features as small as 7 nanometers.<sup>1</sup>

  <p>Global Tech presuppposes global trading cooperation primarily because of rare metals. But more importantly, fabrication specialties growing up in foreign <i>Research Parks</i>.  And, entreched technological specializations are a function of the depth of itemized specializations that sprout around universities and public/privately funded research parks, coupled with the technical workforce to put glass to screen.</p>
  <p class="quote">Even if every part was made in the US, an iPhone would cost about $100 more, Kakaes concluded, assuming raw materials were still purchased on global markets.<br /><br />

  The issue is not so much cost of putting an iPhone together, or even the cost per part on paper. The issue is skill, scale, expertise, and infrastructure — all of which require money, time and long-term investment. Unlike other manufacturing jobs that have migrated from the United States, Apple wouldn’t be bringing them “back” so much as starting from scratch. The cost would come in attempting to build a system that’s never been in the US, but has been built over decades abroad.<sup>2</sup>

This, after the Ethereum (WEI) declines nearly ten-fold along with Bitcoin's 70% drop<sup>1</sup>, along with other major crypto-currencies. </p>
  <p>The story is less dramatic and mysterious than it is simply the natural course of market novelties' <i>transition from Early Adapters to General Acceptance</i>: The underlying value transitions from increasing public awareness to mainstream acceptance, which requires new, ensuing <i>expectations that differ from the previous period</i>. The substance of perceived value dictates actual value. Buterin opines to Bloomberg News...
    <p class="quote"> 
     The blockchain space is getting to the point where there’s a ceiling in sight. If you talk to the average educated person at this point, they probably have heard of blockchain at least once. There isn’t an opportunity for yet another 1,000-times growth in anything in the space anymore ... Growth in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the blockchain community through its first six or seven years was dependent on marketing and trying to get wider adoption. <br /><br /> 
That strategy is getting close to hitting a dead end.  The next step will be getting people who are already interested in cryptocurrencies to be involved in a more in-depth way. "Go from just people being interested to real applications of real economic activity" [Buterin] said.  <sup>2</sup></p> 
    <img src="dist/img/diffusion.jpg" class="zoom" />
    <p>So, the old expectations generated a very low bar to prove actual utility, whereas present-day collective knowledge demands clearer practical proof; inherently the bar is raised. And now, by technical sweat of the brow, crypto-based fintech now faces the realities of what will be needed for wide-spread use: technical solutions to scalability problems, security issues, and of course speed, availability and consistency of data transfer. Yet, now more importantly, ease-of-mainstream-use. </p>
    <p>For example, Ethereum contract writers must learn a new language, Solidity; and Ethereum currency holders must grapple with browser-to-ledger interfaces like MetaMask, which are far from intuitive for even the most enthusiastic of early adopters!  </p>
    <p> This concept is laid bare in sociological terms, citing Rogers and Shumacher's 1971 article from my Feb. 15 post: the general sociological Early Adopter theory--based on Everett M. Rogers' Diffusion of Innovations theory, describing the timeline of the Innovation Adoption Lifecycle as fairly ordinary, or better stated, fairly historical--again repeating itself.<sup>3</sup> </p>

Crypto-currencies in all forms have sustained a 9-month decline, which most could not have anticipated.  Take for instance, December 2017's $1500 Ether value to recent values of $185<sup>1</sup>, and Bitcoin's November 2017 valuation of just under $20,000 on the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) down to this week's $6,400.  </p>
     
     <img src="dist/img/cryptocurrency.jpg" class="zoom" />
     <p>The theories are multi-fold:</p>
     <p class="quote">Some have posited that blockchain and cryptocurrency projects might be converting their ether reserves into fiat currencies to meet financial obligations. At face value, this appears plausible, as startups incur many expenses during their growth phase. If a collection of companies liquidated the cryptocurrencies—mostly ether—that they raised in ICOs at the same time, they could exert downward pressure on prices.<sup>2</sup></p>
       <p>Others blame investment psychology ... </p> 
       <p class="quote">It’s possible that the price decline reflects a negative feedback loop, a combination of economics and psychology. As crypto investors sell their holdings, they see that prices are falling. This could spook them into selling even more. This is somewhat like a bank run, except investors lose faith in the value of cryptocurrencies rather than the viability of a financial institution.<sup>2</sup>
       </p>
       <p>Others still, they blame ease-of-use and accesibility ... </p>
       <p class="quote">Cryptocurrency investors (and especially ethereum backers) may be disappointed (paywall) by the low usage of decentralized applications (dapps) like IDEX, Bancor, and CryptoKitties. These apps run on crypto tokens, and thus generate demand for the assets.
<br /><br />
       But when investors visit a cryptocurrency exchange, they aren’t presented with information about the daily active users on various dapps. They’re generally only presented with the price of an asset and a chart of its history.<sup>2</sup>
       </p>
       <p>However one distributes the blame, psychological and economic explanations only fail where sociological explanations offer coherent explanations ... Look no further than my September 10th post ...

     <p class="firstparagraph">Quantum solutions to computing needs become clearer, and specific uses for research come to light. First and foremost, quantum mechanics offer a realm of solutions that has ever eluded modern science: problem-solving algorithms that face orders of complexity of 40 to 50 orders of magnitude, i.e. Complexity<sup>50</sup> is just a tad too complex for the fast, but straight-line dumb A.I.-based solutions, which are inherent to classificatory machine-learning schema. Blockchain and Directed Acyclic Graphs are less helpful, but find their utility in the unescapably fast ability to <i>share data where data is needed</i><br /><br /></p>
     Manipulations of the quantum realm are not at all intuitive to concepts we learn from the classical world. Less intuitive are the constraints of the data analysis. For example, the quantum metaphor of flipping two coins simultaneously means knowing the "state" of one coin if you know the other coin's state. The one lands on heads, and because it shares an entangled state with the other, <i>you are guaranteed to know the outcome of the second coin</i>. </p>

     <p>Superconducting devices offer powerful tooling, yet <i>the catch is that the time you have to run calculations is approximately 50 micro-seconds</i>, i.e. the <strong>coherence time of entangled, superposed state</strong>. (a marked improvement from 1990's hardware that yielded coherence time of 1 nano-second). Not exactly enough time to run a long program, especially if you consider just one small algorithm is a series of logical gates that depend sequentially on other logical gates..., let alone an actual program. So then what's the use? The specific uses in academic research are without limit for those problems that present specific, exponential complexity--many cases in biotech, chemistry, and so on. Quantum computing offers a 'burst' of calculations, and nothing more, at least for now. </p>

     <p>Not to be underestimated, quantum calculations operate best when modeling the laws of nature--because nature obeys quantum mechanical rules, beginning with chemistry. After all, quantum analysis simulated the largest molecule last year--and that's no small matter!  </p>

After all, they are the solid, predictable workhorse for transporting web surfers' requests and web servers' responses. But could there be improvements even with this, beyond the HTTPS' security upgrade? Wired reports: </p>
  <p class="quote">Chrome looks ahead to its next 10 years, the team is mulling its most controversial initiative yet: fundamentally rethinking URLs across the web.
<br /><br />
  Uniform Resource Locators are the familiar web addresses you use every day. They are listed in the web's DNS address book and direct browsers to the right Internet Protocol addresses that identify and differentiate web servers. <br /><br />
  As web functionality has expanded, URLs have increasingly become unintelligible strings of gibberish combining components from third-parties or being masked by link shorteners and redirect schemes. And on mobile devices there isn't room to display much of a URL at all.  The resulting opacity has been a boon for cyber criminals who build malicious sites to exploit the confusion.
  <br /><br />
  The focus right now, they say, is on identifying all the ways people use URLs to try to find an alternative that will enhance security and identity integrity on the web while also adding convenience for everyday tasks like sharing links on mobile devices.<sup>1</sup></p>

Barred from taking evasive action on its own, the computer abruptly handed control back to its human master, but the master wasn’t paying attention. Elaine Herzberg, aged 49, was struck and killed, leaving more reflective members of the tech community with two uncomfortable questions: was this algorithmic tragedy inevitable?
