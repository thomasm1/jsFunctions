If you swap graphite for silicon, far more lithium ions can be stored in the anode, which increases the energy capacity of the battery. But packing all these lithium ions into the electrode causes it to swell like a balloon; in some cases, it can grow up to four times larger.\n<br /><br />\nThe swollen anode can pulverize the nanoengineered silicon particles and rupture the protective barrier between the anode and the battery\u2019s electrolyte, which ferries the lithium ions between the electrodes. Over time, crud builds up at the boundary between the anode and electrolyte. This both blocks the efficient transfer of lithium ions and takes many of the ions out of service. It quickly kills any performance improvements the silicon anode provided.\n<br /><br />\nOne way out of this problem is to sprinkle small amounts of silicon oxide\u2014better known as sand\u2014throughout a graphite anode. This is what Tesla currently does with its batteries. Silicon oxide comes pre-puffed, so it reduces the stress on the anode from swelling during charging. But it also limits the amount of lithium that can be stored in the anode. Juicing a battery this way isn\u2019t enough to produce double-digit performance gains, but it\u2019s better than nothing.\n<br /><br />\nCary Hayner, cofounder and CTO of NanoGraf, thinks it\u2019s possible to get the best of silicon and graphite without the loss of energy capacity from silicon oxide. At NanoGraf, he and his colleagues are boosting the energy of carbon-silicon batteries by embedding silicon particles in graphene, graphite\u2019s Nobel Prize-winning cousin. Their design uses a graphene matrix to give silicon room to swell and to protect the anode from damaging reactions with the electrolyte. Hayner says a graphene-silicon anode can increase the amount of energy in a lithium-ion battery by up to 30 percent.<sup>1</sup>\n    </p>\n    ';

We provide an overview of the software architecture and building blocks through several examples and review the theory of hybrid quantum-classical neural networks. We illustrate TFQ functionalities via several basic applications including supervised learning for quantum classification, quantum control, and quantum approximate optimization. Moreover, we demonstrate how one can apply TFQ to tackle advanced quantum learning tasks including meta-learning, Hamiltonian learning, and sampling thermal states.

This deal is seen as an early step in these agencies digging into potential anticompetitive practices by all four companies.

    Most cross-border payments are done through the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, or Swift, a Belgian organization started in 1973 that counts 11,000 financial institutions as members. But its legacy system has inefficiencies. Because few banks are connected directly to each other, a payment that originates in Kansas City and is bound for Nairobi might have to stop at banks in New York and London before reaching its final destination, with each bank extracting a fee. 
    https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2019/06/11/visa-targets-swift-with-new-blockchain-product-for-global-money-transfers/
    Visa seems to do everything on a massive scale. Last year, it moved $11.2 trillion over its payment rails across more than 200 countries for purchases ranging from cups of coffee to cars. Now it’s eyeing an even bigger market: cross-border, business-to-business (B2B) transactions, where banks transfer money on behalf of corporate customers. Visa says it’s entering a $125 trillion market and using distributed ledger technology—software where transactions must be confirmed by multiple computers on a network to be considered final—to make these payments faster, cheaper and more transparent.
    Phalen’s team created Visa B2B Connect using distributed ledger technology because it provides more transparency and traceability than a typical state-of-the-art database, he says. They used Hyperledger Fabric, the blockchain software developed in part by IBM and hosted by Linux, to build it, and it has taken two years to launch. Unlike cryptocurrency-based blockchains including Bitcoin and Ethereum, Visa’s product isn’t decentralized, since the payments giant has complete control over it. Visa made Forbes’ first-ever Blockhain 50 list earlier this year.

    Unlike the original vision spelled out in the Nakamoto paper, these initiatives don’t use a proof-of-work system for verification, but are permissioned blockchains in which each participant is identified and known—and therefore accountable—to the others in the blockchain network. Essentially this verifies members before transactions take place, much as Global Entry and TSA Pre do at airline security checkpoints.

    IBM hath been busy ...
    "To understand what the future of blockchain could look like, it’s helpful to look at IBM ’s recent initiatives to build communities around peer-to-peer networks in financial services, identity and supply chain.
    The company is also working with SecureKey to develop a digital identity system in Canada. The system is designed to allow consumers to develop digital identities that they can control. 
    Perhaps the greatest opportunity for blockchain technology is in helping to streamline supply chains. In fact, a 2013 study by the World Economic Forum found that reducing back-office friction in international trade could increase GDP by nearly 5%. IBM has two major efforts in this area. It partnered with Maersk to create TradeLens, which aims to digitize global shipping and created Food Trust that focuses on agricultural products."

    And then there's the question of what type of 5G signals are available. Verizon, like AT&T, has focused on what's known as millimeter wave spectrum, which is fast but has a limited range and can have trouble with walls and even foliage. Carriers in Europe and Asia, along with Sprint and T-Mobile in the US, have been using sub-6GHz airwaves for slower but more reliable coverage.

    The bigger goal, Palmer said, is to enable whole new experiences -- in education, for instance, transporting someone who's studying glaciers to an actual glacier via virtual reality or a holographic experience that's not possible today.
    When the next generation matures eventually, a whole array of technologies will be able to blossom in ways that today's 4G networks don't allow -- cars communicating with each other and with sensors on a highway or city streets at speed, for instance. The internet of things becomes a lot more than just you checking in with your Nest thermostat or an August smart doorbell. Soldiers and first responders get better, faster situational awareness.

    /// Quantum::: mainstream
    AUTHOR::: Yun-Hee Kim at yun-hee.kim@wsj.com
    Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
    Quantum computers won’t replace today’s traditional computers, but they will become mainstream within five years, a top executive in charge of emerging technologies at International Business Machines Corp. predicted.
    Speaking at The Wall Street Journal’s Future of Everything Festival Wednesday, Arvind Krishna, senior vice president of cloud and cognitive software, predicted that with quantum computing, batteries could last “a thousand times longer” and airplanes could become lighter.
    “All of these use cases, I think, will get solved in a few years,” Mr. Krishna said. “Pharmaceuticals and drug discovery is a much harder problem.”
    Quantum computers have the potential to sort through a vast number of possible solutions—more than the number of atoms in the universe—with the calculations being completed as fast as a fraction of a second.
    Responding to criticism from researchers that the U.S. may be falling behind China and the European Union to invest in quantum computing, Mr. Krishna said the U.S. is currently slightly ahead but does need to invest more. China is constructing a $10 billion research center for quantum applications. The European Union announced in 2016 that it is creating a €1 billion effort on four areas of quantum technology including computing and communication.
    Mr. Krishna, who also oversees the integration of IBM’s $33 billion acquisition of Red Hat Inc. said he expects the deal—IBM’s largest acquisition to date—to close around June. The company has received approval from the U.S. Department of Justice for the deal, and is now awaiting approval from the European Union.
    Asked about restructuring after the acquisition is completed, Mr. Krishna said that it wouldn’t result in any job cuts at Red Hat.
    “This is a value deal, not about cost synergy. They [Red Hat] run on multiple public clouds. It’s got to be preserved,” he said.
    In the public cloud space, IBM trails rivals Amazon Inc. and Microsoft Corp. IBM ranked fifth in the world for public cloud-infrastructure service in 2017, according to data from Gartner Inc., behind Amazon, Microsoft, Alibaba Group Holding Inc. and Google Inc.
    But Mr. Krishna said the acquisition creates a big opportunity for IBM to expand in the so-called hybrid cloud space where customers run some software in their own data centers but also use cloud services.
    “I’m not trying to catch up to Amazon and Microsoft,” he said. “They are going down the path of public cloud and we are going to be hybrid. There is so much investment that’s already happening and there is so much data that can’t sit on the public cloud. I believe there is space for all of us,” he said.

    In November, the company revealed it had started testing its first-generation qubit devices, followed in January by the claim that it had “demonstrated record-breaking high fidelity quantum operations” on its trapped-ion qubits. In March, it announced it had demonstrated “parallel operating zones” on the device, which it believes will provide faster execution and more flexible qubit connectivity.
    Honeywell’s attraction to trapped ion technology mirrors that of IonQ, namely that these atomic level structures are totally uniform, naturally resistant to error-producing noise, and can be connected to one another in different configurations at runtime. While this technology doesn’t have the decades-long history and proven scalability of semiconductors, at this point, it offers the most interesting alternative for solid-state quantum computing.

China is constructing a $10 billion research center for quantum applications. The European Union announced in 2016 that it is creating a \u20AC1 billion effort on four areas of quantum technology including computing and communication.\n\nMr. Krishna, who also oversees the integration of IBM\u2019s $33 billion acquisition of Red Hat Inc. said he expects the deal\u2014IBM\u2019s largest acquisition to date\u2014to close around June.

John Halamka, chief information officer at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts, told MIT Technology Review last year that there are 26 different electronic medical records systems in his home city alone.\n    <br /><br />\n    In 2016, Halamka teamed up with a group of scientists at MIT to try to find a solution to the problem using blockchain. They published their white paper on the subject in August 2016, laying out their proposal for a system that would help all those disparate databases exchange data\u200A\u2014\u200Aa project they called MedRec.\n    <br /><br />\n    Andy Lippman, a senior research scientist at MIT, co-authored the paper with Halamka. The system they outlined was to use Ethereum software\u200A\u2014\u200Awhich, unlike bitcoin, can integrate and execute smart contracts\u200A\u2014\u200Ato build a private blockchain, linking healthcare providers together and allowing them to share their data.\n    <sup>2.</sup>\n    </p>\n    <p>So, as usual, Ethereum wins the day for both daily applicability and now a more scalable <strong><i>and</i> conscientious</strong> crypto-currency Tech!\n\t';

Despite the quantum-directed molecular behavior of biological organisms, the classical exponentiation of machine-learning statistical algorithms still does work miracles:  \n  </p> \n  \n  <p class="quote"> \n  Studies indicate that using algorithms to analyze digital slides delivers diagnoses as accurate as an expert pathologist\u2014and in some instances, the algorithms are more accurate. A 2018 study by Massachusetts General Hospital and MIT found that an automated system they developed diagnosed dense breast tissue (an indicator of breast cancer) in mammograms at the same level as an expert radiologist. Another algorithm developed by Google was found to \u201Chelp detect metastatic breast cancers with significant accuracy and improve pathologist performance,\u201D according to studies in the Archives of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine and the American Journal of Surgical Pathology.\n  </p>\n  So, how can we best take advantage of these advances? Clear the brush! The meta-organization of healthcare technology and financing simply can\'t keep pace with the pure tech:\n  <p class="quote">\n  After taking a look, the pathologist might ship it to a specialist at another lab for a second opinion. Each time the slide is moved, it is packed up and shipped to a different address. All the while, you\u2019re waiting days or even weeks to hear whether or not you have cancer.\n<br /><br />\n  For decades, there have been limited ways to share medical slides, with information management lagging behind even as medical science advanced. But in the past few years, a new industry of digital pathology has emerged that could finally offer a more efficient and large-scale way of distributing and analyzing these kinds of samples.\n  <sup>1</sup>\n  </p>\n  <p>So, the good news from <i>the doctors\'</i> occasional nemesis, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, decided that after 8 years of trials and hearings, truly scalable and sufficiently large sample data can now be digitized - hence personalizing the law of large numbers from the whole to the individual patient.

The data was then posted to a popular hacking forum and appears to be an amalgamation of over 2,000 databases. The troubling thing is the databases contain \u201Cdehashed\u201D passwords, which means the methods used to scramble those passwords into unreadable strings has been cracked, fully exposing the passwords.\n<br />\n  So what does this mean for the average person? According to Hunt, it means compromised email and password combos are more vulnerable for a practice called credential stuffing. Basically, credential stuffing is when breached username or email/password combos are used to hack into other user accounts. This could impact anyone who has used the same username and password combo across multiple sites.<sup>1</sup>\n  </p>  ';

The following October, Avi Loeb, the chair of Harvard\u2019s astronomy department, co-wrote a paper (with a Harvard postdoctoral fellow, Shmuel Bialy) that examined \u2018Oumuamua\u2019s \u201Cpeculiar acceleration\u201D and suggested that the object \u201Cmay be a fully operational probe sent intentionally to Earth\u2019s vicinity by an alien civilization.\u201D Loeb has long been interested in the search for extraterrestrial life, and he recently made further headlines by suggesting that we might communicate with the civilization that sent the probe. \u201CIf these beings are peaceful, we could learn a lot from them,\u201D he told Der Spiegel.<sup>1</sup>\n  </p>  ';

Perfectionistic leaders often don\u2019t communicate their \u201Chigh standards\u201D until others miss their expectations. When you observe a gap between what you get and what you wanted, pause before reacting. Ask yourself if the person who fell short understood what you expected.

So New Horizons had days to capture photographs and spectrographic readings of the former planet, but for this smaller cosmic quarry, it only had a matter of minutes.

There and in bouncing-droplet labs that soon sprang up at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and elsewhere, droplets were seen to tunnel through barriers and perform other acts previously thought to be uniquely quantum. In reproducing quantum phenomena without any of the mystery, the bouncing-droplet experiments rekindled in some physicists de Broglie\u2019s old dream of a reality at the quantum scale that consists of pilot waves and particles instead of probability waves and conundrums.<br /><br />\n\nBut a series of bouncing-droplet findings since 2015 has crushed this dream.

  var blogpost10 = '\n<p class="firstparagraph">Climate-change scientist-activists earn their prestige with every research study and every letter written. With less fanfare, economists also earn their due prestige for working toward a sustainable prosperity.     </p>\n<p class="quote"> This year\u2019s [Nobel Prize] Laureates William Nordhaus and Paul Romer have significantly broadened the scope of economic analysis by constructing  models that explain how the market economy interacts with nature and knowledge. <br /><br />\n Romer demonstrates how knowledge can function as a driver of long-term economic \ngrowth. When annual economic growth of a few per cent accumulates over decades, it transforms people\u2019s lives. \nPrevious macroeconomic research had emphasised technological innovation as the primary driver of economic \ngrowth, but had not modelled how economic decisions and market conditions determine the creation of new \ntechnologies. Paul Romer solved this problem by demonstrating how economic forces govern the willingness of \nfirms to produce new ideas and innovations. \n<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p>The economist in turn practices what he preaches by using only open-source software--to the aim of democratizing research itself:</p>\n<p class="quote">Romer believes in making research transparent. He argues that openness and clarity about methodology is important for scientific research to gain trust. As Romer explained in an April 2018 blog post, in an effort to make his own work transparent, he tried to use Mathematica to share one of his studies in a way that anyone could explore every detail of his data and methods. It didn\u2019t work. He says that Mathematica\u2019s owner, Wolfram Research, made it too difficult to share his work in a way that didn\u2019t require other people to use the proprietary software, too. Readers also could not see all of the code he used for his equations.\n<br /><br />\nInstead of using Mathematica, Romer discovered that he could use a Jupyter notebook for sharing his research. Jupyter notebooks are web applications that allow programmers and researchers to share documents that include code, charts, equations, and data. Jupyter notebooks allow for code written in dozens of programming languages. For his research, Romer used Python\u2014the most popular language for data science and statistics.<sup>2</sup>\n</p>\n<p>The Bottom line is that yesterday\'s ink and paper is today\'s software and hardware--essential tools for success, the earlier the better. So, because historical suppression usually begins financially, equal access across social and economic lines.  So, the economic incentive to outfit every last citizen with free wifi and open-source technology. Already, the best in humanity--the Nobel winners--know the public incentive to harness the power of a widespread tech education. Because when the many and not the few create and advance technology, the economy blooms with real productivity.</p>\n  ';

Imagine a lawyer who took all of that personal information and sold it to somebody else. But they\'re governed by a different relationship, which is the fiduciary relationship.

Growth in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the blockchain community through its first six or seven years was dependent on marketing and trying to get wider adoption. <br /><br /> \nThat strategy is getting close to hitting a dead end.

First and foremost, quantum mechanics offer a realm of solutions that has ever eluded modern science: problem-solving algorithms that face orders of complexity of 40 to 50 orders of magnitude, i.e. Complexity<sup>50</sup> is just a tad too complex for the fast, but straight-line dumb A.I.-based solutions, which are inherent to classificatory machine-learning schema. Blockchain and Directed Acyclic Graphs are less helpful, but find their utility in the unescapably fast ability to <i>share data where data is needed</i><br /><br /></p>\n     Manipulations of the quantum realm are not at all intuitive to concepts we learn from the classical world. Less intuitive are the constraints of the data analysis. For example, the quantum metaphor of flipping two coins simultaneously means knowing the "state" of one coin if you know the other coin\'s state. The one lands on heads, and because it shares an entangled state with the other, <i>you are guaranteed to know the outcome of the second coin</i>. </p>\n     <img src="dist/img/quantumScience.jpg"  class="zoom" />\n     <p>Image credit: TechCrunch Disrupt! Day 3</p>\n     <p>Superconducting devices offer powerful tooling, yet <i>the catch is that the time you have to run calculations is approximately 50 micro-seconds</i>, i.e. the <strong>coherence time of entangled, superposed state</strong>. (a marked improvement from 1990\'s hardware that yielded coherence time of 1 nano-second). Not exactly enough time to run a long program, especially if you consider just one small algorithm is a series of logical gates that depend sequentially on other logical gates..., let alone an actual program. So then what\'s the use? The specific uses in academic research are without limit for those problems that present specific, exponential complexity--many cases in biotech, chemistry, and so on. Quantum computing offers a \'burst\' of calculations, and nothing more, at least for now. </p>\n     <img src="dist/img/quant-python.jpg" class="zoom" />\n     <img src="dist/img/quant-python2.jpg" class="zoom" />\n     <p>This short python-language program demonstrates quantum manipulation to machine-learning classification distinguishing a dog from a cat</p>\n     <p>Image credit: TechCrunch Disrupt!

  var blogpost7 = '<p class="firstparagraph">Predictive analytics  has slowly progressed in sophistication over the past 45 years, and the current nexus with powerful machine-learning tools changes the health game: </p>\n    <p class="quote"> A report by ABI Research June 2018 report highlighted a significant rise in patient monitoring devices, including AI for home-based preventative healthcare and predictive analytics, which could save hospitals around $52bn by 2021.<br /><br />\n\n    Accenture\u2019s Digital Health Technology Vision 2018 report also claims that 85% of health executives in the US believe that every human will be directly impacted on a daily basis by an AI-based decision within the next three years.<br /><br />\n    \n    Utilising big data generated by clinical information and research can reveal clusters and patterns which can benefit all aspects of healthcare, leading patient care to become increasingly strategic.<sup>1</sup>  </p>\n    <p>It should be noted that the long road paved by statistical theory has revolutionized the above-mentioned fields as much as it now powers the practical use of analytics:</p>\n    <p class="quote">Originating in the statistical (e.g., Holland\n      1986; Rosenbaum 2002; Rubin 2005, 2006) and\n      econometrics literature (see Heckman 2000,\n      2001, 2005; Heckman & Vytlacil 2007a,b;\n      Manski 1995, 2007), the counterfactual,\n      Rubin, or potential outcomes model of causality\n      has, over the past three decades, become\n      the standard conceptual tool to unify the notion\n      of causality, to understand the identification\n      problem at the heart of causal inference,\n      and to assess the utility of alternative estimation\n      techniques (Sobel 2005).<sup>2</sup></p>\n      <p>So, the take-away here is that A.I. and <i>Machine-Learning Research could have never progressed so quickly if not for the settled scientic paradigm over sound analysis that rules out spurious variables, while properly weighting the conditions that matter.</i> Furthermore, the mistakes in algorithm design were made in the 1970\'s, 1980\'s, and 1990\'s--misleading mistakes--have been swept aside, providing much-tested and refined strategies. The medical field\'s case exemplifies this evolution:</p>\n    <p class="quote">Randomized controlled trials are considered the gold\n    standard for assessing the efficacy of medications, medical\n    procedures, or clinical strategies. Nevertheless, particularly\n    for research on the prevention of chronic disease, randomized\n    trials are often infeasible because of their size, time,\n    and budget requirements, as well as questionable generalizability\n    or ethical constraints.<br /><br />\n    On the other hand, nonexperimental studies of interventions\n    have frequently been criticized because of their potential\n    for selection bias. This concern reached a crescendo\n    with the disparity in estimated effects of hormone replacement\n    therapy from randomized trials and nonexperimental\n    studies. This imbroglio highlighted the need to develop\n    and apply improved methods to reduce bias in nonexperimental\n    studies in which selection bias or confounding is\n    likely to occur .<sup>3</sup></p>\n    <p>So, nowadays we don\'t ask for a second opinion when we can ask for a trillion opinions narrowed down to one heck of a second opinion!</p>';

A x86 CPU can do AI, but it does a task in 12 steps when only three are required; a GPU in some cases can also be overkill.\n    <br /><br />\n    Generally, scientific computation is done in a deterministic fashion. You want to know two plus three equals five and calculate it to all of its decimal places\u2014x86 and GPU do that just fine. But the nature of AI is to say 2.5 + 3.5 is observed to be six almost all of the time without actually running the calculation. What matters with artificial intelligence today is the pattern found in the data, not the deterministic calculation. \n    <br /><br />\nThe result of this predictive problem solving is that AI calculations can be done with single precision calculations. So while CPUs and GPUs can both do it very well, they are in fact overkill for the task. A single-precision chip can do the work and do it in a much smaller, lower power footprint.</p>\n\n<p class="quote">Intel "can deliver on CPU functionality, which has dropped in performance, but still lags on GPUs and modems," noted Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the Enderle Group.\n\n"Much of the performance these days is gated by the modem and the GPU, not the CPU, which just isn\'t as importance as it once was," he told TechNewsWorld.\n\nDevelopers may not benefit much from the new processors, Enderle said, because "with IDF shut down, Intel\'s developer efforts are largely moot."\n</p> ';

We\'re now seeing the initial stages of this transformation.<br /><br />\n    \n    For instance, funding is growing more internationally distributed, and startups are making necessary adjustments to prove sustainability and secure a seat at the table. Most fintech segments in the ascendant a year ago have continued to rise and grow more valuable to the broader financial system. Meanwhile, several fintech categories have had to make adjustments to stay on top. New subsegments are also appearing on the scene \u2014 such as digital identity verification fintechs \u2014 as new opportunities for innovation are discovered. \n    <br /><br /> ... \n    The rising influence of fintechs is having a dramatic effect on incumbents, from banks to insurers to wealth managers, pushing them to respond proactively to stay relevant. Incumbents are reacting to changes wrought by fintechs on three key fronts: the front end, the back end, and in their core business operations. As such, incumbents and fintechs are converging on a digital middle ground.\n  <br /><br />\n    As this happens, the fintech industry is on the cusp of becoming an integral component of the broader financial services ecosystem. But it will likely first have to go through a complete credit cycle, and survive an economic downturn like the one that set the stage for its arrival in 2008, for this to happen.<sup>2</sup>\n    </p>\n    ';

To this, the Canadian A.I. Mafia chimes in:</p>\n  <p class="quote">A persistent challenge for Element is the dearth of good data. The simplest way to train A.I. models is to feed them lots of well-labeled examples\u2014thousands of cat images, or translated texts. Big Tech has access to so much consumer-oriented data that it\u2019s all but impossible for anyone else to compete at building large-scale consumer products. But businesses, governments, and other institutions own huge amounts of private information. Even if a corporation uses Google for email, or Amazon for cloud computing, it doesn\u2019t typically let those vendors access its internal databases about equipment malfunctions, or sales trends, or processing times. <br />\n  <br />That\u2019s where Element sees an opening. If it can access several companies\u2019 databases of, say, product images, it can then\u2014with customers\u2019 permission\u2014use all of that information to build a better product-recommendation engine. Big Tech companies are also selling A.I. products and services to businesses\u2014IBM is squarely focused on it\u2014but no one has cornered the market. Element\u2019s bet is that if it can embed itself in these organizations, it can secure a corporate data advantage similar to the one Big Tech has in consumer products.<sup>1.</sup></p>\n  <p>\n   <p>So will this kind of data democratization work?

  var blogpost4 = ' \n  <p class="quote">In the Modern Field of Artiificial Intelligence, all roads seem to lead to three researchers with ties to Canadian universities. The first, Geoffrey Hinton, a 70-year-old Brit who teaches at the University of Toronto, pioneered the subfield called deep learning that has become synonymous with A.I. The second, a 57-year-old Frenchman named Yann LeCun, worked in Hinton\u2019s lab in the 1980s and now teaches at New York University. The third, 54-year-old Yoshua Bengio, was born in Paris, raised in Montreal, and now teaches at the University of Montreal. The three men are close friends and collaborators, so much so that people in the A.I. community call them the Canadian Mafia.<sup>1.</sup></p>\n\n  <p class="firstparagraph">A curious path of punctuated advancement due to insufficient memory and cpu power, characterized late 20th century A.I. development: Deep Learning development   lulls interrupted by rapid growth with each successive technological period.\n   Toronto\'s Dr. Geoff Hinton\'s single-layered A.I. algorithm gained brief fame, yet A.I. research no longer advanced  for ten years. </p>\n   <p class="quote">\n   Programs that performed well in the laboratory were useless in everyday situations; a simple act like picking up a ball turned out to require an overwhelming number of computations.\n\nThe research fell into the first of several \u201CA.I. winters.\u201D As Bostrom notes in his book, \u201CAmong academics and their funders, \u2018A.I.\u2019 became an unwanted epithet.\u201D<sup>1</sup> \n</p>\n<p>\nThen came the GPU with Alex Khreshinski\'s famous image-recognition competition-winning penmanship detector, which notably is still in use by the banking system. This novel use of the GPU to accomplish parallel calculations rewrote the the A.I. field overnight. Also known as the "Cambrian Explosion", this event (and really just the algorithm) set off widespread advancements in the weeks and months follwoing, leading to new speciation ranging from the ANN, Neural Network, to a whole alphabet soup from Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) <i>to far-reaching mutations of Reinforcement Learning</i>.<sup>2</sup>\n  </p>\n \n  <p> Along with Hinton\'s close collaborator throughout the 1980\'s and 90\'s, Dr. Yoshua Bengio of the University of Montr&eacute;al, the researchers remain committed to humanity\'s service:</p>\n   \n  <p class="quote">\n  Hinton moved from the U.S. to Canada in part due to disillusionment with Reagan-era politics and disapproval of military funding of artificial intelligence.[22] He believes political systems will use AI to "terrorize people". Hinton has petitioned against lethal autonomous weapons. Regarding existential risk from artificial intelligence, Hinton has stated that superintelligence seems more than 50 years away, but warns that "there is not a good track record of less intelligent things controlling things of greater intelligence". Asked in 2015 why he continues research despite his grave concerns, Hinton stated "I could give you the usual arguments. But the truth is that the prospect of discovery is too sweet." Hinton has also stated that "It is very hard to predict beyond five years" what advances AI will bring.<sup>1</sup></p>\n  \n  <p>While Hinton and company aren\'t necessarily Mahatma Gandhi-like, their devotion to a science prioritized to humanity\' service and long-term best interest--free from monetary or other influence is admirable. No wonder their outlook on A.I.\'s utility is so much brighter than that of Pessimist Elon Musk and company ... baah-humbug!\n </p>\n   \n \n  ';

This is the flurry-to-snowstorm of Privacy Policies simultaneously released in response to the E.U.\'s May 25th General Data Protection Regulations.  In reference to my June 30th post on A.I. workplace solutions, months of busy-reading-work all distilled to a fraction of the time to analyze those policies. Guess what? The rule-breaking is well under way!</p>\n  <p class="quote">Researchers from the European Union Institute in Florence worked with an EU consumer organization to create the software. They then used the program to examine the privacy policies of 14 major technology businesses, including by Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., and Facebook Inc.<br /><br />\n \n  They found that a third of those clauses were "potentially problematic" or contained "insufficient information." Another 11 percent of the policy\u2019s sentences used unclear language, the academics said.  The researchers didn\u2019t make public which companies\u2019 policies violated which provisions of the law, publishing only aggregate findings for all of the companies in the study.<sup>1</sup></p>\n \n  <p>Aha! <i>The practices of Tech companies\' use of A.I. to analyze customers\' private data is well-known, but <strong>what do we actually know</strong> beyond just that? Behind the veil of commercial secret, much less is known than is led on ... until now. Now, A.I. becomes increasingly useful as a tattle-tale! </i> So by the same token that tech creates problems, Tech is the first to provide a solution. But A.I. rule-checking sounds good but raises another question: Who owns, or can access by alternate means, the personal data we have strewn across the internet? And what quality of data does each party have, or shares?  </p>\n  ';

Economists predict any of these scenarios will force the average worker to do practically the same thing throughout their careers: keep learning and learning and learning.\n<br /><br />\nSome colleges in the United States are already preparing for this age of perpetual education, including the University of Michigan\u2019s Ross School of Business. The Ann Arbor school launched a scholarship program that pays for graduates to take classes there forever, and the number of students is slowly growing.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p>\n<p>But what really is the time-scale on this big transformation? Most things operate like they always have, and honestly, maybe we can be a little more picky about what, how, and <strong>why  we "optimize" the things we do.

A more telling detail from the New York Times:</p>\n<p class="quote">And we\u2019ve digitized only about 20 percent of the economy, meaning there\u2019s tremendous technological climate change yet ahead.

As I sat, a train of reflection occurred to me, which led me to consider the effects of what I was now doing. <br />\n  <br />\n  --Victor Frankenstein<sup>1</sup>\n  </i><br /> \n</p>\n<p class="firstparagraph">Nvidia\'s latest 12" by 4" by 4" GPU accelerates algorithmic work from 1<sup>1/2</sup> months to 4 days. The most recent exponential leaps in computing power--most notably for A.I. purposes, are thanks only to the Graphical Processing Unit. Progress followed a linear path in as 1998 world, a world enlightened by the pivotal A.I. publication, "Convolutional Neural Netowrks for Handwritten Digital Recognition" (Lecun, Bottou, <strong>Bengio</strong>, Haffner, 1998) to the present use in blockchain computing and deep learning algorithms, among many other purposes. The technical advantage offered by Nvidia explained by 2012\'s "ImageNet Classification with NVIDIA GPUs (Krizhevsky, Hintou, et al.). Ten years ago, Daniele G. Spamintato and Anne C. Elstery offer a succinct explanation:\n</p>\n<p class="quote">Optimization algorithms are becoming increasingly more important in many areas, such as finance and engineering. Typically, real problems involve several hundreds of variables, and are subject to as many constraints. Several methods have been developed trying to reduce the theoretical time complexity. Nevertheless, when problems exceed reasonable sizes they end up being very computationally intensive. Heterogeneous systems composed by coupling commodity CPUs and GPUs are becoming relatively cheap, highly performing systems.\n<br />\n<br /> Recent developments of GPGPU technologies give even more powerful control over them. In this paper, we show how we use a revised simplex algorithm for solving linear programming problems originally described by Dantzig for both our CPU and GPU implementations. Previously, this approach has showed not to scale beyond around 200 variables. However, by taking advantage of modern libraries such as ATLAS for matrix-matrix multiplication, and the NVIDIA CUDA programming library on recent GPUs, we show that we can scale to problem sizes up to at least 2000 variables in our experiments for both architectures. On the GPU, we also achieve an appreciable precision on large problems with thousands of variables and constraints while achieving between 2X and 2.5X speed-ups over the serial ATLAS-based CPU version. With further tuning of both the algorithm and its implementations, even better results should be achievable for both the CPU and GPU versions.<sup>2</sup></p>\n<p>So, given the exponential development advantages of GPU use, it\'s clear the horizon for more and more developers implicates high computing needs.  So, what exactly is novel yet increasingly a household developer tool? </p>\n<p class="quote">\nCUDA\xAE is a parallel computing platform and programming model developed by NVIDIA for general computing on graphical processing units (GPUs). With CUDA, developers are able to dramatically speed up computing applications by harnessing the power of GPUs.<br /><br />\n\nIn GPU-accelerated applications, the sequential part of the workload runs on the CPU \u2013 which is optimized for single-threaded performance \u2013 while the compute intensive portion of the application runs on thousands of GPU cores in parallel. When using CUDA, developers program in popular languages such as C, C++, Fortran, Python and MATLAB and express parallelism through extensions in the form of a few basic keywords.\n<br /><br />\nThe CUDA Toolkit from NVIDIA provides everything you need to develop GPU-accelerated applications. The CUDA Toolkit includes GPU-accelerated libraries, a compiler, development tools and the CUDA runtime.\n<sup>3</sup></p>\n<p>And, this tech is arriving at both the mainstream PC-optimization level as much as typical university research, the potential of both laid out in a June 2018 Wired Magazine article:</p>\n<p class="quote">PCs that work on smartphone parts.

  var blogpost3 = '<p class="firstparagraph">Deep Learning--a 70\'s thing--clearly predates   personal computing, the web, and even the 70\'s Show. But the true advances have been a long time in development, and credit belongs to Statistics and Data Science, and specifically quantitative analysis\' ever cleverer classification trees that deliver the goods with greater accuracy, coupled with less intensive computing costs. And this origin is interesting in itself: </p>\n <p class="quote">\nFifty years have passed since the publication of the first regression tree algorithm. New techniques have added capabilities that far surpass those of the early methods. Modern classification trees can partition the data with linear splits on subsets of variables and fit nearest neighbor, kernel density, and other models in the partitions ... <br />\n<br />Classification And Regression Trees (CART) (Breiman et al., 1984) was instrumental in regenerating interest in the subject. It follows the same greedy search approach as  Automatic Interaction Detection (AID) and THeta Automatic Interaction Detection (THAID), but adds several novel improvements. Instead of using stopping rules, it grows a large tree and then prunes the tree to a size that has the lowest cross-validation estimate of error. The pruning procedure itself is ingenious, being based on the idea of weakest-link cutting, with the links indexed by the values of a cost-complexity parameter. This solves the under-fitting and over-fitting problems of  AID and THeta Automatic Interaction Detection (THAID), although with increased computation cost.<sup>1</sup>\n</p>\n<p>Today, Machine Learning curricula usually begin with the same sample datasets on Iris characteristics (pictured below)</p>\n<img style="min-width:300px;"  src="dist/img/learningData.PNG"><br /><br />\n<p>So how does it really work, in oversimplified terms? Contrary to most algorithms\' step-by-step manual decision-making through for- and while-loops, if-else, and so on, the scalability of design clearly falls off. Enter Deep Learning, which is nothing more mystical than simple classification--i.e. decision--trees. Beginning with a million choices, a decision passes through multiple layers that may or may not be activated, and with each activated layer, a decision is narrowed down, until finally a decision is reached between recognizing a dog and a cat!\n</p><img style="min-width:300px;" src="dist/img/classifTree.PNG">\n</p><img style="min-width:300px;" src="dist/img/classifTree2.PNG"><br /><br />\n<p>And yet, for all of this science, up until 2011, the error rate for simple shape recognition, like say a dog from a cat still averaged a 26% error rate! A mere 7 years later? Today, that error rate averages less than 3% error, most recently due to computing, power, and memory advances.   Those come in handy for delivering a warehouse worth of computing onto your smartphone! That\'s a boon for delivering sensors, i.e. training data, into the environment. My last post mentioned Google\'s upcoming, yet unnamed Android OS...but we do know it\'s a candy that starts with "P"...my guess is Peppermint Patties? Or maybe Pez has more of a ring to it.</p>  \n<p  >\nWhatever the new OS is called, it comes with a developing potential to exponentially advance <i>Tree Science</i>:  ML Kit behaves like an API layer connecting the ML software to the app developers\' models, making dev easy to run and deploy with an "experimental model compression flow that aims to reduce model size (up to orders of magnitudes) while maintaining similar accuracy."<sup>3</sup> Talk about maturing exponentially quickly! Now, this origin story can\'t compete with Wolverine\'s nor Han Solo\'s, but this gem carries a mythical and futuristic potential to satisfy screen-goers from all devices, frame-sizes, and platforms!</p>\n';

ML Kit allows developers to use the camera for face detection, landmark recognition, text recognition, and a host of other recognition features.<sup>2</sup></p>\n<p>\nSo, in conceptual terms, this means developing app-data models that are <i>optimized for mobile inference</i>. This means that the long process of acquiring enough training data to optimize an app\'s design or behavior (generally or specifically user personalization), can now be shortened with better quantity and quality of training data &aacute; la machine learning. So in concrete terms, the past 15 years\' of Google ML research is now distilled into (again, still beta) an SDK (software developers\' kit) that facilitates dev integration without needing to hand-make a model to access the run-time environment. \n</p>\n<p>In other words, past server-side inferences now jump to the mobile device, and tap into   on-device machine learning library framework and toolkit--i.e. TensorFlowLite. This jump-starts customized application of machine learning already in production--that is, Android devices\' <i>Neural Networks API</i> and <i>iOS\' Metal</i>.  \n</p>\n<p>What makes this new programming horizon most interesting is that an equally new feature, called "Actions" and "Slices",  allows for certain app features to be accessed by the phone itself outside of the app. A May 8th Verge article explains:\n\n</p>\n<p class="quote">\nGoogle is introducing developers to a couple of terms: \u201CActions\u201D and \u201CSlices.\u201D They are essentially deep links into apps that are able to surface in other parts of the operating system. Actions are analogous to Actions on Google Assistant; Slices are a subset that can show the app\u2019s own UI when you type out a global search on the phone.\n<br /><br />\nThe idea behind both of these concepts is to break out the different pieces of the apps you use into the larger operating system. Samat calls it the \u201Cdecomposition of apps,\u201D though without the connotations of death. \u201CYeah, you want to go the app,\u201D he says, \u201Cbut actually what you want to do is go to your house or reorder from Instacart.\u201D\n<br /><br />\nDevelopers will need to build some frameworks into their apps to make Actions and Slices available to the system. When they do, the AI in Android P will try to understand what those apps can actually do and suggest those actions to you. \u201CWhen you modularize the app, it\u2019s not just an API call,\u201D Samat says. \u201CYou have these components that can be understood by the system, predicted by the system, and then rendered by the system.\u201D<sup>3</sup>\n</p>\n<p>So what does this mean?

  var blogpost1 =  `<p class="firstparagraph">Blockchain technologies, i.e. Government contracts, Business contracts, Bitcoin and other
  cryptocurrencies, all rely on network graph theory, both on the low-level programming technology (peer-to-peer global
  ip networks) across the spectrum to high-level interfaces for institutional, corporate, individual needs and uses.
  These blockchain &quot;network&quot; analyses depend on highly variable--and simultaneous--network changes, node
  changes, and link changes; and, the latter three may arbitrarily change interdependantly or not.</p>
  
  <p>Therefore, blockchain technologies must first accomodate  complex node variables, including one- or two-way contracts (relationships) that
   depend on<i> arbitrarily hierarchical mappings and conditional data structures.</i> Secondly, blockchain tech must face analytical
  challenges that arise from informal practices<sup>1</sup><span class="new">--you can survey opinions, but how do you measure whim?</span>
  The organizational nodes (employees) choose to deviate from their employment roles&#39; protocol <span class="new">because it it is sunny outside, or maybe because the traffic was long today, or because a butterfly's wing-swish cooled a rash decision down to reason.  That small detail often trumps statistical patterns of efficiency, convenience, company culture, and multiple other levels of analysis of human factors.</p>
  
  <p>Sociologists Meyer &amp; Rowan&#39;s (1977)
  <i>New Institutionalism</i> explains how employees change practices and decouple
  <i>actual</i> organizational structure from recorded rules, as a function of organizational size, time, convenience,
  etc. Noone can argue against this wall of reason. <span class="new"><i> The problem is not the reason, the problem is the static, frozen wall called Social Science Theory, constructed from a pastiche of different meanings</i> and arbitrary theoretical starting points.  <span class="new">The esteemed Scholar of Comparative Politics, Dr. Ellen M. Immergut, undermined modern sociology concepts in 1998--a logical blow from which Sociology has never recovered (nor yet faced). She writes:</span>
  </p>
  <p class="quote new">
  Further confusion has arisen because the new institutionalists do not propose one generally accepted definition of an institution, nor do they appear to share a common research program or methodology. In fact, three separate branches of scholarship--rational choice, organizational theory, and historical institutionalism -- all lay claim to the label, seemingly without adhering to an overarching theoretical framework.<sup>3</sup></p>
  <p class="new">
  In other words, the long-standing Civil War within the discipline of Sociology (beginning with Functionalists' irreconcilable contradictions of Conflict Theorists' entire World-View--and vice-versa). From this initial schism begins the disassembling of the discipline--as it stands until today. 
  All of that talent and no single vision to harness a lasting explanatory platform.  And this is <i>before</i> addressing--from a Scientific Method Paradigm--the problem of continually new, unknown constraints on data that must be intimately understood without falling back to the old, "USA Today" habits of 'Theoretical Relativism'.</p>
  </span>
  <p>
  So, how do we recognize unwritten, soft rules and behaviors of a bank, a person,
  or a company&#39;s internal bot?</p> 
  <p>The hard sciences domain of Software Engineering, Computer Science, and Mathematics have brilliantly brought the
  world the blockchain tool, based on a <span class="new"><i>technical, numerical aptitude--numeracy--for which the Hard Sciences can and must share and propogate it's technical expertise and higher standard of metric truth</i><s style="color:purple" class="strike-purple"> not contribute everything, especially relating with</s> to the other sciences that are still lagging behind--namely The Discipline of Sociology</s> toward acclimating to the modern age's social priorities and needs. Ask yourself, how well do 1,000 top blockchain-related programmers understand the multi-dimensional layers of hierarchical social, corporate, and governmental relationship networks--probably 700 of the 1,000. And how many social scientists can understand the technological sciences? Probably 200 out of 1,000. This means that <i>a chunk of the scientific displines suffer from acute innumeracy</i>. So how do we bridge this massive knowledge gap between qualitative meaning in the smart-contract?</span></p>
  <p>In the past, the layers of abstraction from raw technological tool to societal use was refined, improved, integrated through multiple layers of &quot;middlemen&quot;, such as lawyers, corporate lawyers, government institutions, non-governmental, non-profit and for-profit actors. Blockchain technology, by its very nature, erases the middlemen. Suddenly, one programmer, for example, is writing the same healthcare insurance crypto-contract, that last month an entire team of hospital employees spent a month writing; then overseeing and managing different facets of this same thing.</p>
  
  <p>However, the crypto-contract, once deployed to the blockchain, auto-manages the rest, forever or for the life of
  the contract. Therefore, rather than redoing the trials and errors of 200 years&#39; Sociology Network Analysts&#39;
  research and analytical development. <span class="new"> Therefore, much of the social scientists have arrived at the end of the line of technology, still shackled to analog methodology relegated to the Sine and Cosine of progress; while the World leaves it behind, led by the Hard Sciences of Software Engineering--the new social fabric of the 21st Century. So, can the anthropological and social domains survive this existential threat to any authority--that depends if the Hard Sciences, Gatekeepers of Empirical Science will extend an open door and pro-actively share technical instructions for the soft sciences.  Therefore, the social sciences are not safe hiding at home, within the academic
  tower--far removed from the pace of societal and technological change.  
  </p>
  
  <p class="new">The point is this: The innumeracy of the Soft Sciences increasingly loses authority, with the less it can prove at the Command Line Interface. So, how will an analog academic field in the early 21st century compete with artifical intelligence? Problems grow exponentially in the modern age, and only the sciences with  machine-learnig on their side can expect to thrive by applying extraordinary applications of machine-learning to network theories. <span class="new">
  Sociologists deal with real-time, logical and hierarchical network mappings that appear arbitrary, yet are characterized by fixed patterns. This implies a higher level of competency to accurately judge a point-of-view without the ability to directly consult machine learning. <i>This is a Code or Be Coded moment in the life trajectory of the social sciences.</i></span></p>
  
  <p>  <i>the Power  of the Social Sciences, even while paraliyzed, cannot be underestimated:</i> No other academic field than sociology has advanced into the details, and endless network rabbit-holes that characterize societal behavior. Not until this second millenial decade could the marriage of Large Number Statistical Theory
  become consumated with the brilliance of early 1900&#39;s Sociological French Network Theories, like Maurice Halbswach&#39;s
  work on the clearly defined network patterns of a society&#39;s Collective Memory.</p>
  
  <p>So, current sociology, having collected and refined knowledge on network arbitrariness, such that Economic&#39;s &quot;irrational
  behaviors&quot; and Mathematical &quot;complexity models&quot; do not
  <i>touch to the bone</i> the meaning, the intersectionality of network analysis, which must incorporate simultaneous
  node changes (person gets job /or/ does not get job), network changes (All get jobs /or/ only 3 of 15 network groups
  get jobs), and most importantly the
  <i>relationship</i> changes (all jobs always useful /or/ half of job groups no longer useful) across time and fixed.</p>
  
  <p>Fine. So, why is Sociology&#39;s network theory so valuable, yet inaccessible, beyond just the network insights gleaned from 19th and
  20th centuries&#39; network problems?  European sociology came of age in the analog social era, while North
  American Sociology only recently come of age (Quebec in the 1960&#39;s [post-1968], U.S. in the 1990&#39;s[post-1999],
  in the digital social era. Therefore, the problem-solving patterns of past sociology are inherently small-data and
  more qualitative analysis, and thus only Sociology incorporates &quot;human-ness&quot; into the billion rows and
  columns of quantitative--numbers-only--analysis.</p>
  
  <p>For example, Oxford-developed S.I.E.N.A. Software accomplishes this task. SIENA--named for Simulation Investigation
  for Empirical Network Analysis--software calculates the real-time values, direction, and conditions of each relationship
  (link) in a network, simultaneously as each node, network, or alter-link changes or is changed; with this, it is
  possible to isolate directional, conditional
  <i>influence change</i> in real-time. Real-time sounds impossible, however, the SIENA documentation
  <sup  >2</sup> describes its program algorithm to the statistical analysis of network data, with the focus on social networks.</p>
  
  <p>An easy example to grasp this is the concept of whether a person
  <i>self-selects </i>(e.g., due to subconscious leanings) into a group and thus matches to fruition the group&#39;s
  behavior with little group influence? Or does this same person join a group and emulates the group&#39;s behavior,
  by the group&#39;s influence over time. Sociological network analysis, using Snjder&#39;s SIENA software, achieves
  the impossible with the closed, directed graph networks that characterize blockchain technology. The network graph
  can be here understood as entire (complete) networks (i.e, the blockchain in its entirety without hard forks), not
  as personal (egocentered) networks: Using this SIENA model allows for the necessary assumptions that a set of nodes
  (social actors) is given, and all ties (links) between these nodes are known - except perhaps for a moderate amount 
  of missing data</p> 
  <p>If, and only if, this level of analysis may be achieved, the blockchain development may follow a linear, directed
  path of maturity with social and world needs.<span class="new"> Until   Social Science Network Theorists stop from basing their numerical analysis on the mutable sand of theory, rather than theory based on the   foundation of numerical science, <i>any attempt at conclusion...you guessed it...cannot be conclusive.</i>So, the social sciences must consult the hard sciences, otherwise they risk squandering countless years of talented theorists' work; <i>the discipline's executive functions are cut off from it's increasingly inaccessible (and increasingly powerful) knowledge base.</i> --Such a talented, powerful Thoroughbred of a Science, that still wanders without a head for technical direction.</span></p>

I decided to make my first recipe with WebAssembly and JavaScript, (with yes, a third called <i>Emscripten</i> and no, my eyes aren\'t rolling) ... this waaas amazing, Wow! So I thought to write about the nuts and bolts of it all. </p>\n<p>So,   what exactly <i> is </i> WebAssembly, specifically?? It\'s this:<span style="color:purple"> (And, for the jargon-wary, skip this paragraph </span> :-)</p>\n<p class="cite">\n$ emcc -s WASM=1 -o fib.js fib.c </p><p class="green">\n<i>emcc</i> executes the <i>Emscripten</i> compiler<br />\n<i>-s</i> ensures that Emscripten outputs WebAssembly<br />\n<i>-o fib.js</i> names the output as fib.js<br />\n<i>fib.c</i> And, finally this is the input file\'s name!<br />\n<p>\nThis first part? It\'s like staring into a solar eclipse (I confess I glanced at one recently (but didn\'t we all, secretly?)) ... <br />\nAnyway, this is a simple, classic example using Fibonacci sequence<sup>2</sup> for familiarity. Here\'s the input:<br />\n</p>\n<pre>\nfib.c:\n#include <emscripten.h>\n\nEMSCRIPTEN_KEEPALIVE\nint fib(int n) {\n  int i, , a = 0, b = 1;\n  for  (i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n    t = a + b;\n    a = b;\n    b = t;\n  }\n  return b;\n}</pre> \n<p>\nSo, given the integer absence in JavaScript mentioned in the <a href="#18-05-10">May 10th post</a>, The Fibonacci integer sequence example illustrates the   relationship between WebAssembly and Javascript. Unlike JavaScript\'s lack of integers, WebAssembly\'s math kit is nothing short of luxury! \n</p>  \n<script src="fib.js"></script>\n<script> <span class="green">This part is JavaScript carrying out the instructions receieved from Emscripten:</span>\n  Module.onRuntimeInitialized = _ => {\n    const fib = Module.cwrap(\'fib\', \'number\', [\'number\']);\n    console.log(fib(12));\n  };\n  <script>\n</p>\n<p>So what happened back there is that <i>Emscripten outputs <strong>two </strong>files, one JavaScript (fib.js) and one WebAssembly (fib.wasm)</i>.. Simple enough, and that\'s why massive, intractable application programs like AutoCAD can now be easily deployed on any platform, fast and high-function on our mobile phones. True it is, <i>after first glance, all  this jargon\'s inner beauty shines, a real harbinger of great apps to come!</p>\n\n';

  var blogpost10 = '<p class="firstparagraph">WebAssembly,  about a year old, provides a new level of performance to mobile apps and the browser generally, but is it safe? It\'s actually safer than traditional plug-ins for browsers. Here\'s a quick recap from yesterday\'s post on WebAssembly:</p>\n<p class="quote">WebAssembly is one of the biggest advances to the Web Platform over the past decade.\n\nThis new standard will enable amazing video games and high-performance web apps for things like computer-aided design, video and image editing, and scientific visualization. Over time, many existing productivity apps (e.g. email, social networks, word processing) and JavaScript frameworks will likely use WebAssembly to significantly reduce load times while simultaneously improving performance while running. Unlike other approaches that have required plug-ins to achieve near-native performance in the browser, WebAssembly runs entirely within the Web Platform. This means that developers can integrate WebAssembly libraries for CPU-intensive calculations (e.g. compression, face detection, physics) into existing web apps that use JavaScript for less intensive work.<sup>1</sup>\n</p><p>\nBrowsers, <i>despite HTTPS encryption, are growing in security weaknesses</i> with more territory, responsibilities, and new API relationships. However, along with WebAssembly\'s solutions for CPU-intensive browser operations (like AutoCAD example in the previous post), WebAssembly also offers unique security solutions:  \n</p>\n<p class="quote">WebAssembly describes a memory-safe, sandboxed execution environment that may even be implemented inside existing JavaScript virtual machines. When embedded in the web, WebAssembly will enforce the same-origin and permissions security policies of the browser.<sup>2.</sup></p>\n<p>\n This architecture   signifies eventual compatibility with the existing Block Chain apps like MetaMask that use a browser plug-in to set up an API between, for example, the Ethereum blockchain and Web access. So, with WebAssembly\'s great potential with JavaScript, is it a safer, more secure on-line world? No, but <i>there are safer corners </i> ... and certainly a safer niche for drawing space!</p>\n\n';

  var blogpost9 = '<p class="firstparagraph" id="05-10-18">AutoCAD, the first name in 3-D engineering, has stepped into a new world in the past month. Recent, unprecedented mobile app advances allow more CPU-intensive laptop applications to hop to the phone with equal interactivity and near-equal functionality. Thanks to third-party languages, JavaScript, the browser\'s language, is broadening in powers: And this is nothing short of exhilarating with just enough of a touch of danger.\n</p><p>AutoCAD\'s recent advances in their mobile platform exemplifies this trend.<sup>1</sup> AutoCAD, the ancient, foundational, ultra-powerful, ever-modernizing programming codebase--celebrates 35 years old, and predates the web! AutoCAD by AutoDesk has historically had difficulty implementing its codebase into mobile platforms. So, their app presence suffered because it had been highly watered down, and suddenly competing with thousands of other 3-D engineering apps...Until now. </p><p>\n\n<p class="quote">Yesterday [March 2, 2018] was a big day for the AutoCAD product. A multi-year engineering project \u2013 started in the AutoCAD team way back when I was part of it \u2013 culminated in its first deliverables getting into the hands (or, in this case, browsers) of customers.  The AutoCAD team has been working on a project codenamed \u201CFabric\u201D for the last several years. It\'s has been a huge amount of work \u2013 something I\u2019ll hopefully get into in a future blog post \u2013 but it\u2019s finally bearing tangible fruit.  In broad strokes the work was to take the core of AutoCAD and make it cross-platform. </p><p class="quote">You might consider the Big Split \u2013 work that was done ostensibly to build AutoCAD for Mac but resulted in a Core Engine that became the mechanism through which developers could run custom code in the cloud via AutoCAD I/O (now part of Forge\u2019s Design Automation API) \u2013 to be the first phase of this effort. At the very least Fabric stood on the shoulders of the Big Split.<sup>2.</sup></p><p>\n\nIn short, AutoDesk\'s latest browser-based AutoCAD Web App and Mobile App have suddenly advanced a quantum step. For example, the mobile app provides nearly all of the full features (not including 3-D rendering), like swapping .DWG files from cloud services using a full mobile interface.  </p>\n<p>\nNot just for AutoCAD, but all apps improve, because <i>third-party languages like WebAssembly can "broker" the API conversation between browser and the operating system\'s machine code for certain tasks</i>.<sup>3</sup> Exceptionally interesting, now WebAssembly performs real-time C++ transpiling allowing any browser to communicate in near-to direct machine-code for certain tasks. \nWebAssembly (Wasm) is a "binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine ... designed as a portable target for compilation of high-level languages like C/C++/Rust, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications."<sup>3</sup> In other words, <i>WebAssembly is the middle-person translating between JavaScript\'s V8 Engine and a device\'s Operating System</i>. Here\'s  a clearer explanation using the AutoCAD example:</p>\n<p class="quote">[AutoCAD\'s] Fabric has done away with #ifdefs, forcing any platform-specific code into a PAL (Platform Abstraction Layer) per targeted platform. And Fabric is able to target more than just Windows and OS X. Some of the main targets were the established mobile platforms (more on that down the line), but one major effort was to target the web platform with the AutoCAD codebase.\nYes, you read that right\u2026 yesterday\u2019s update to AutoCAD Web now runs the same core code as standard AutoCAD, but in a browser. A major part of AutoCAD\u2019s C++ codebase gets run through Emscripten (at least that\u2019s my understanding \u2013 I\u2019ll correct any details I get wrong) to be transpiled into WebAssembly. \n<p>\n<p>So, it looks like our <i>wild, untamed language, JavaScript, has matured to the big-leagues </i> by teaming up with WebAssembly ... After all, JavaScript, among all the languages, was born without a mind for math... literally. It\'s core math library conducts all operations in 64-bit floating point, in the absence of integers! So, this entails occasional anomalies: For example, .1 + .2 does not equal .3! (Try it with the JavaScript calculator below ... ) And so, great things await this partnership between WebAssembly and JavaScript, but every marriage is different... one partner may always need help cooking, and another may always need help with the math, but that\'s what Marriage is for!</p>\n\n\n \n';

Having several miners ratify and vote to accept a transaction lends blockchain what some say is a greater degree of security that the ledger contains a single version of the truth than under DAG-based systems. \n  <br />\n  <br />\n  IOTA, the best-known DAG, is already the No. 10 largest cryptocurrency, with $6.6 billion in market capitalization, according to CoinMarketCap. \n  \n  \u201CEven first-year computer science students here at MIT laugh at the code when they see it,\u201D Tadge Dryja, a research scientist at MIT who is working to scale the Bitcoin network, said in an email. \n  \n  The hack MIT came up with \u201Ccan\u2019t happen in practice,\u201D Serguei Popov, one of the founders of IOTA, said in a phone interview.\n  \n  \nHashgraph uses DAG differently: It uses it to record different aspects of transactions than IOTA, and has different security characteristics, according to hashgraph developers.\n<sup>1</sup>\n   \n\n\n\n  ';

The formal release is on May 9th, but this May 1st press release caught my attention as we see a glimpse of this technology on a public* ledger: \n</p>\n<p class="quote"> CULedger and Hedera today announced a partnership whereby CULedger will use Hedera\'s hashgraph platform and public ledger to build a system for cross-border payments. CULedger has already been using the private ledger version of hashgraph, offered by Swirlds, for general purpose, permissioned ledger use.<sup>1</sup> </p>\n<p>The big news is Hedera\'s "public" blockchain ledger service that moves closer to popular usage with it\'s unique <i>directed acyclic graphs</i>, whose speed increases with scale.  Until recently, Blockchain tech has been hamstrung in the domain of micro-transactions, so now that the barrier has been crossed, how many sectors of life will be enhanced? All. But not yet. Once 5G technology (100 times faster, 100 times the capacity of 4G) is rolled out, then we hit the big leagues.</p> \n<p class="quote">A group of U.S. credit unions looking to pool resources considered the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains to track their business, but wound up selecting something else entirely: hashgraph.</p>\n<p class="quote">Currently, cross-border payments are painful for all parties involved," said Rick Cranston, COO of CULedger. "They take time, they\'re expensive, and there is limited visibility into the transaction. Hashgraph is fast and it provides visibility between the two parties at a significantly lower cost. It also eliminates concerns regarding fraud and default, since transactions are recorded immutably on the public ledger, and manual processes, since transactions are automated via smart contracts.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p> ...to be continued...</p> \n\n';

The premise of the show, and the current state of A.I., is instinctual learning and behavior of A.I.--i.e. imitating animal-behavior, but not human. </p>\n  <p>I had the good luck of spending the Fall of 2016 in the Silicon Valley of A.I. technology, which is Montr&eacute;al, Qu&eacute;bec (For example, UdeM was awarded $100 million in research money from Facebook). Though I was there for a Sociology PhD, I still got to get involved like any technology groupie would...  The rock-star out there is Universit&eacute de Montr&eacute;al\'s Dr. Yoshua Bengio,<sup>3</sup> who explains the consciousness elements of A.I, and how those compare with our own representations:\n  </p>\n  <p class="quote">\n  With supervised learning, humans provide the high-level concepts that the computer learns, which can be tedious and limits the ability of computers to discover things by themselves. Unsupervised learning, or what we call reinforcement learning, is when the learner is not merely passively observing the world, or how humans do things, but interacts with the environment and gets feedback. Humans are good at this. Combining unsupervised deep learning and reinforcement learning is one of the things that I am working on.<sup>2</sup>\n  </p> \n  <p>So, here we see how Yoshua Bengio  explains that <i>building of meaning, symbolic representation as the key impediment</i>. To get around this, representations are <i>factorialized</i>, which is a clean way of saying multiple levels/dimensions of classification trees:</p>\n  <p class="quote">For more than a decade, my research has focused on the notion of learning better representations, which is the heart of deep learning, in particular, representations that have a property called disentangled. Disentangled separates the different concepts and different explanations - we call them factors - that explain the data, that explain what the agent sees around it, and that explain how the agent patrols the world. Disentangled captures some of the causality that explains what we are seeing and what the computer is seeing.<sup>2</sup>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n  I think it\'s exciting subject matter, and perhaps many would be less apprehensive if they thought of A.I. as achieving the behavior and  <i>predictable mind of pets</i>.  Pets and service pets can be a reassuring thought--even for A.I. pessimists like Elon Musk. Pets...

Two months ago, my <a href="#18-02-23">Feb. 23rd blogpost</a> and again on <a href="#18-03-08">March 8th</a> I mentioned 1.4 million new tech jobs, 20% growth year-over-year. And so, yours truly has decided to enter into this market after a post-graduate period of contracting and free-lance work. Let\'s face it, there\'s no substitute for the stability and the fixed schedule, plus the coffee-machine conversations are never short of endearing! </p>\n\n\n  <p>So far on day 2 (Friday, the 21st was my ceremonial first day of "putting myself out there"). I\'ve thought to start slow, while I gauge the territory, but Indeed and Linkdin are always safe bets to begin with. All in all, my general take is that this new job front, with hundreds of thousands of jobs month-over-month is for everyone. Most positions offer 9-12 weeeks training -- who ever said changing careers had to be shouldered on our own? HR is there! </p>\n  <p>As I am a night-blogger, therefore my new position--where and whichever it will be, won\'t interfere with my blogging--after all, I have truly enjoyed watching my readership grow, month-by-month ... so, thank you, dear tech readers. As such, perhaps along the way I can lend a view from the job-front, and any new trends I observe.</p>\n  <p>Examples aren\'t hard to find. I\'ve noticed that since the last time I\'ve checked out the job market, the pre-assessment tests are a bit more cognitive than previous years, which is good for strong test-takers--especially those that love to calculate the "arrival times of two separate trains leaving the same station at two different rates of speed ....". 50 questions in 15 minutes makes for a nice adrenaline rush--on par with a short run!  </p>';

  var blogpost13 = '\n  <p class="firstparagraph">Bitcoin\'s rise to prominence, the mystery of Satoshi Nakamoto\'s identity--i.e., author of <a href="dist/docs/bitcoinWhitePaper.pdf" target="_blank"> the original Bitcoin White Paper</a>, and the platform\'s reliability (outside of value fluctuations) all add to the mystique of the crypto-currency.  Yet,     new advances and types, i.e. "groupings" of blockchain technology are not necessarily "replacing" their predecessors, but rather filling different blockchain needs; Needs that include speed of transactions, truly public distributed ledgers, safety from forking and DDOS attacks.  Since 2008,   groups of competing platforms follow a timeline, but should not be thought of as a cyclical evolution but rather growing tree branches that form "groups".  Bitcoin, Litecoin are first generation, while Ethereum and Ripple are 2nd generation with crypto-contract capability, and finally Iota and Swirlds\' Hedera Hashgraph represent   3rd generation <i>directed-acyclic-graphs (DAG), whose transaction speed actually  increases</i> with number of nodes.\n  </p>\n  <p>Each of these groupings shouldn\'t be seen as making the previous design obselete: They   serve different purposes. Bitcoin can never serve micro-transactions and the micro-economy because it can only handle 6 transactions per second (TPS), while Ethereum can handle 12 or so. However, micro-transaction industries require TPS in the hundreds of thousands! Only the 3rd gen  crypto-currency architecture   achieves TPS <i>ad infinitum</i> because it\'s scalability increases with size. The catch? DAG\'s are necessarily private entities, rather than the original two generations that are by nature public, yet can be privatized. 3rd generation DAGs are the opposite: They are by default private, and cannot truly be distributed without management. Further, <i>Swirlds Hashgraph has patented their source code, which contradicts many principles of blockchain technology</i>, beginning with core tenets  of the original crypto-currency white paper, published in October 2008. For history\n  \'s sake, here\'s a quick view of the Bitcoin paper\'s abstract:</p>\n  <p class="quote"><strong>Abstract.</strong> A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled byi nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they\'ll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.<sup>1</sup></p>\n  \n  <p>Irrespective of crypto-currency or crypto-contract, there seems to be a different kind of jump from 2nd generation to 3rd generation blockchain, rather than a progression. Research needed to fork into a different direction is because of the need for instantaneous, ordered transactions, which can never be provided by a blockchain design which "syncs" every 5 to 10 minutes. </p>\n  <p> So, what is this 3rd generation design? Instead of a singular block encapsulated in linked cryptographic, historical ledger blocks, hashgraph uses a "tangle" of one-way (directed-acyclic) network connections. This means that speed increases with the number of nodes, overcoming the Bitcoin micro-transaction problem. <i>In sum, near-instantaneous updates for financial, betting, gaming and social-media data needs are solved by the  third-generation DAG</i>, while longer-term and truly distributed blockchain needs will always be the terrain of first and second generation blockchain technology. So, given that Swirlds\' Hedera Hashgraph will be unveiling their platform next month,   blockchain critics and enthusiasts can and should read between the lines, er, I mean-- read  between the nodes ...</p><br />\n  <p class="cite">0.

And, for all the pitfalls of Iota and the ever-evolving Ethereum (and ever-present threat of forking), Bitcoin stands true among the crypto-currency platforms. Keeping it Simple,   the very limited, non-crypto-contract may just be Bitcoin\'s virtue.

Maybe, Maybe not, but where does the future lie for all that hardware? Where does the browser fit into this? First, what\'s going on under the hood: Note this article is older, but accurate in explanation--except for references to Bitcoin\'s value! </p>  \n  \n  <p class="quote">New bitcoins are created roughly every 10 minutes in batches of 25 coins, with each coin worth around $730 at current rates. [A typical home-] computer ... is racing thousands of others to unlock and claim the next batch.</p>\n  <p class="quote">\n  Let\u2019s start with what it\u2019s not doing.  \n  Your computer is not blasting through the cavernous depths of the internet in search of digital ore that can be fashioned into bitcoin bullion. There is no ore, and bitcoin mining doesn\u2019t involve extracting or smelting anything. It\u2019s called mining only because the people who do it are the ones who get new bitcoins, and because bitcoin is a finite resource liberated in small amounts over time, like gold, or anything else that is mined. (The size of each batch of coins drops by half roughly every four years, and around 2140, it will be cut to zero, capping the total number of bitcoins in circulation at 21 million.) But the analogy ends there.\n  </p><p class="quote">\n  What bitcoin miners actually do could be better described as competitive bookkeeping. Miners build and maintain a gigantic public ledger containing a record of every bitcoin transaction in history. Every time somebody wants to send bitcoins to somebody else, the transfer has to be validated by miners: They check the ledger to make sure the sender isn\u2019t transferring money she doesn\u2019t have. If the transfer checks out, miners add it to the ledger. Finally, to protect that ledger from getting hacked, miners seal it behind layers and layers of computational work\u2014too much for a would-be fraudster to possibly complete.<sup>1</sup>\n  </p>\n  \n  <p>So all of this hard work <i>can be distributed</i> across browsers, which improves its energy-expensive plight. I wouldn\'t recommend running the demo in the article link below as it may overheat your device--it had my fan running double-time. But the internals are using JavaScript code for the math. Here\'s a look under the hood, and it\'s nice to see the role of <i>JavaScript graphics library, called D3JS, (Data Driven Documents)</i> playing a central role. So, below you see the browser accepting the SHA256 Hash along with the Bitcoin Owner\'s Address, and the JavaScript in the browser passes off calculations to the C++ running the JavaScript V8 engine on your computer. </p>\n  <img src="./dist/img/miningBlockchainD3.PNG" class="zoom" width="450px" />\n  <p>And so, what does it mean to mine Bitcoins across browsers in a distributed fashion? It is similar to the same concept as Ethereum\'s direction (or at least idealized by its architect, Vitalik Buterin), in running the Ethereum Virtual Machine blockchain across all the browsers that download its GETH software. Nonetheless, here\'s a succinct explanation of the browser\'s role,again from Quartz: </p>\n  <p class="quote">Mining\u2019s ultimate purpose is to prevent people from double-spending bitcoins. But it also solves another problem. It distributes new bitcoins in a relatively fair way\u2014only those people who dedicate some effort to making bitcoin work get to enjoy the coins as they are created.\n  But because mining is a competitive enterprise, miners have come up with ways to gain an edge. One obvious way is by pooling resources.<br /><br />\n  \n  \n  Your machine, right now, is actually working as part of a bitcoin mining collective that shares out the computational load. Your computer is not trying to solve the block, at least not immediately. It is chipping away at a cryptographic problem, using the input at the top of the screen and combining it with a nonce [run-time, generated random number calculated only once, then discarded], then taking the hash to try to find a solution. Solving that problem is a lot easier than solving the block itself, but doing so gets the pool closer to finding a winning nonce for the block. And the pool pays its members in bitcoins for every one of these easier problems they solve.</p>\n  <p>In practice, distributed mining pays off quite well   for the owners of that address. My blogposts on <a href="# <a href="#18-02-28">February 26th  </a> and <a href="#18-02-28">Feb. 28th about blockchain sustainability</a> paint a less rosy picture of tying the currency value to the cost of energy, but multiple solutions and fixes exist to distribute the energy load to laptops on clean renewables, the mining cooperative way ... after all, who ever said money had to be so expensive? </a> \n  <p class="cite">1.<a href="https://qz.com/154877/by-reading-this-page-you-are-mining-bitcoins/" target="_blank">https://qz.com/154877/by-reading-this-page-you-are-mining-bitcoins/\n  </a> (The article link is harmless, but wouldn\'t recommend running it if low on batteries--it doubled the fan speed)</p>  ';

  var blogpost7 = '<p class="firstparagraph">Day two of Congressional hearings over Facebook\'s Data Privacy and Protections  were better articulated than the first day. Important dialogue surrounded primarily   two data privacy topics: First, financial transparency surrounding ads and political ads based on the <i>Honest Ads Act</i>, for which Zuckerberg pledged support<sup>1</sup>. \n  </p>\n  <p>Second, and   more far-reaching, discussion of the <i>Browser Act</i> also was raised by several House members. While responding to the Act\'s sponsor, Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, Zuckerberg expressed interest in working together. This bill is not well known, but aims to set prudent, consistent guidelines of privacy in the hands of the consumer. </p>\n  <p class="quote"> [Blackburn\'s] new bill targets the full spectrum of the internet, including web giants like Amazon and Google. In Blackburn\u2019s words, it moves the government \u201Cto a posture where we have one regulator, one set of rules [and] everybody knows who\u2019s in charge,\u201D she told Recode.<sup>3</sup></p>\n  <p>So, however the power struggle goes, a <i>shared technology lexicon</i> clarifies that shades of meaning make enormous difference, depending on "what" an entity is--whether a technology is a Platform as a Service  versus media outlet or strictly merchant-based. Hopefully, <i>Tech will lead the way</i> without ceding authority in the process: </p>\n  <p class="quote">\n    But the Tennessee lawmaker\u2019s effort hasn\u2019t won any allies among privacy-conscious consumer groups, like the American Civil Liberties Union, which doubt Blackburn\u2019s methods. And her bill has already prompted a whole new round of fierce lobbying by tech and telecom giants, which don\u2019t see the need for any new regulation at all.\n    </p> \n  <p class="quote">\n  \u201CI think that, in concept, the idea that there should be stronger privacy standards for edge providers and internet service providers is right,\u201D said Neema Singh Guliani, the legislative counsel at the ACLU.</p>\n  <p class="quote">\n  But Blackburn, she added, should have gone about it differently. \u201CThe way to do it was not ... [through] gutting the FCC\u2019s rules; the way to do it was actively working on a replacement.\u201D<sup>3</sup>\n  </p>\n  <p>The bill is similar to the European data privacy model, <i>E.U. General Data Protection Regulation(GDPR)</i>, which serves as point of reference.<sup>2</sup> On May 14,   Europeans will   be implementing a pan-internet--edge and ISP--data protections, which include e-mail, Facebook and other apps, equally as for Comcast and Verizon, and industry-wide privacy defaults; Further, opt-in for privacy is more meaningful separate, and  not relegated to the main Terms and Conditions.<sup>3</sup></p>\n  <p>Policy regulation in other industries--exemplified by medical <i>HIPAA</i>, financial <i>Fair Credit   Reporting Act</i>--reveals the noticeable absence of similar policy in Tech. Tech\'s regulation is however necessarily far more complex, involving at minimum trade-offs between app-to-app data portability and new boundaries for different sources and forms of data.

Although, in this case, <i>there were two, at times three, tennis balls at play!</i> What I mean is that "Data" and "Personal Data" vaccilated in meaning:  At times, Senators\' questions referred to, 1.) personally identifiable data with intimate personal details, full name, location data (sensitive-data); 2.) Other times questions referred to <i>derivative data, i.e. data wrangled, refined, merged with different datasets</i> (composite-data); and,  3.) sometimes the questions meant the harmless, identity-encrypted "ad-data"(anonymized-data); but, usually, Zuckerberg responded to a question about one of these three meanings of "personal data", by responding with a non-abstract fourth: 4.) "Senator, the data, the \'likes\' and pictures you share with Facebook, they are your property," Zuckerberg would answer. Well, thank goodness! </p>\n  <p> My blogpost talks about the shades of meaning: We all know the light-hearted awkwardness when a conversation splits into two separate threads because each party unknowingly follows differing meanings from the same word, or idea.  Austin Powers would have more fun with it, but the Sociologists typically call it  a <i>Semantic Predicament</i>.<sup>1</sup></p> \n  <p>In fairness, Mark Zuckerberg volunteered as he himself was not subpoenaed, and therefore this preliminary, public discourse was critical for creating shared meaning and language about a complex topic. By volunteering to engage conversation with Senators, Zuckerberg interrupts the <i>game of telephone</i>; and, Senators engage with their constituents, and lo, America saves two years\' of misunderstandings for clear data-protection action now. Bravo, Mark! Zuckerberg is perhaps one of the braver CEOs in American history--Now, he has earned his place right next to Andrew Carnegie--and very similar lives, too.

Psychometricians are less causally oriented, as their tool, "factor analysis"--<i>analyse factorielle</i>--reduces complex data to dimple, categorical forms in order to reconcile <i>quantitative data</i> with intuitive categories.<sup>1.</sup> And this research is great for expanding knowledge about society. But to what end? Who\'s to say, after all society is both the subject <i>and</i> object of this research.

  var blogpost17 = '<p class="firstparagraph">\n  Universities, private or public institutions, serve as a beacon for\n  <strong>the Fearless Protection and Ethical Regulation</strong> of information and data. This is because data and data research\n  is innate to the university\'s Mission Statement, whereas business and governmental institutions are relatively new\n  to the game, and often at odds with the\n  <i>Academy</i>, and occasionally against each other. </p>\n  <p class="quote">Threats to student data privacy existed long before the internet. The FBI under J. Edgar Hoover infiltrated Berkeley\n  student groups to counter communism in the 1960s. Around the same time, the CIA manipulated the National Student\n  Association for intelligence gathering in other anti-communism efforts. But the privacy issue is more acute now\n  that the amount of student data in cloud-based systems has grown exponentially and is more widely dispersed.\n  <sup>2</sup>\n  </p>\n  <p> The University\'s expertise over ethically regulated data collection and management, is better than government, business,\n  and even medical domains for two reasons. First, the institution\'s long history and ethical motives with data are\n  unique. The norms of data-handling have been codified through the University\'s Institutional Review Board based\n  on its\n  <strong>stated mission</strong>. In other words, Universities take data seriously\n  <i>for reasons other than corporate profit or governmental control</i>. An example of personal data precautions has\n  played out with Harvard\'s recent data tiffs leading to the Supreme Court, illustrated by a 2016 article: </p>\n  <p class="quote">Last week undergraduates at Harvard University raised concerns about the institution handing over their data to an\n  anti-affirmative action group as part of a lawsuit. Students for Fair Admissions, which is suing the university\n  for allegedly discriminating against Asian American applicants, will have access to \u201Cacademic, extracurricular,\n  demographic and other information\u201D from all undergrads who applied to Harvard between the fall 2009 and spring 2015,\n  omitting names and Social Security numbers.\n  <sup>2</sup>\n  </p>\n  <p>The second reason why Universities understand ethical implications for data is that data and more broadly data and\n  human information\n  <i>research</i> is the institutions\' second highest priority, along with teaching and service. For example, in response\n  to the unethical Public Health research in\n  <i>Tuskegee Syphilis experiements</i>, the University instution\n  <i>stepped in</i> to help design the 1978\n  <strong>Belmont Principles</strong>. Currently, the University Institutional Review Board incorporates this with the Nuremburg\n  Code (developed after WWII NAZI research), in handling data research.\n  </p>\n  <p>In recent days,\n  <i>private companies</i> claim expertise for regulating "Fake News", and you guessed it,\n  <strong>regulation of data privacy &amp; confidentiality.</strong><sup>3</sup> The ethical authority over data privacy norms are nowhere\n  else than the University campus, case in point Harvard...

And yet, this is the age-old-case of new technologies reshaping long-standing fields, especially\n  financial structure - the bottom line! All creative fields also have technological features on the horizon that\n  may, potentially move the playing field. First some recent background: </p>\n  <p class="quote">\n  While [Taylor Swift] is certainly making money in retail sales and digital downloads, both of those metrics are spiraling\n  downward as people migrate away from the concept of owning music at all. Nielsen recently released numbers indicating\n  substantial drops in both CD and digital-track sales, which are down almost $100 million\n  <i>year over year</i> from 2014; streaming music continues to grow, but the revenue it generates isn\u2019t close to making\n  up the difference, yet.\n  <sup>1</sup>\n  </p>\n  <p>Most remember Taylor Swift\'s 2014 industry-shaking album withdraw in protest to Spotify\'s payment structure. The\n  next year Taylor took on Apple iTunes--to which Apple bended to Taylor\'s Way\n  <sup>2</sup>. These wins are amazing but not enough, if only for winning battles in a losing war. </p>\n  <p class="quote">Spotify is the future. Spotify is the enemy. Spotify doesn\u2019t pay enough. Spotify is music\u2019s best bet for revenue\n  growth. Since it arrived in the United States from Sweden in 2011, Spotify has been cast as both hero and villain\n  in the music industry\u2019s continuing debate over streaming music. </p>\n  <p class="quote">\n  It has been hailed as a potential savior through a two-tiered \u201Cfreemium\u201D model that would gradually lure listeners away from\n  piracy. Yet Spotify\u2019s royalty rates have also terrified many artists already worried that each new step in music\u2019s\n  digital evolution further devalues their work.\n  <sup>3</sup>\n  </p>\n  <p>So the trend looks dire, and yet is it really? Where, just where are the\n  <strong>Tech Platforms </strong> leading us?

  var blogpost11 = '\n  <p class="firstparagraph">March 13th, 2018 marks the day that certain types of blockchain technologies, notably Bitcoin and Ethereum, face\n  an existential crisis: Today, a new distributed ledger technology has been announced, which departs from the traditional\n  "Proof-of-Work" (energy-intensive calculations) Blockchain technologies. This is critically important to zero carbon-footprint.\n  For example, Bitcoin calculations drain more energy, 50 TeraWatt/hrs per year--higher than Singapore\'s 49.8!</p>\n  <p>Next, the primary security flaw of consensus-based leadership like Ripple, Iota (as opposed to\n  <i>random-selection blockchain leadership</i> based on carbon-intensive calculations) is they are susceptible to Hacking:\n  Denial-of-Service Attacks are possible because the next leader Block can be anticipated and followed by a Bot),\n  so the blockchain cycle is attacked at every cycle. </p>\n  <p>The Heder Hashgraph unveiled today overcomes this problem by using a 39-node-leader hashgraph data structure. Interestingly,\n  this is based on the original Visa Credit Card design from the 1950\'s (then called AmericaBank) for authenticating\n  system. </p>\n  <p>\n  Next, The Heder Hashgraph overcomes the problem of "fairness" because blockchain transactions are\n  <i>\n  <strong>not ordered in each cycle</strong>.</i> Bitcoin transactions are haphazardly lumped together in each block-cycle,\n  which is ~12 minutes. Which means that time-sensitive financial data queries will always lose! </p>\n  <p>\n  Swirld\'s unveiled their consensus-based\n  <strong>Hashgraph, a type of distributed ledger technology (DLT),</strong> last year. Today, it has now been announced to\n  deploy in late 2018 on the Hedera Hashgraph public network. This is tremendous news! Tremendous, since I explained\n  in my\n  <a href="#18-03-01">March 1st </a> blog post that older blockchain technologies incentivize miners\' efforts by directly tying electrical-cost(\n  (in calculations) to the Bitcoin/hour profit margin. For this reason, the future horizon just considerably shortened\n  Bitcoin\'s runway for establishing anything beyond "early-adopter" status. </p>\n  <p>So, we\'ll see if the innovating crew with Vitalik Buterin\'s Ethereum can successfully alter the crypto algorithm\n  into it\'s planned carbon-free consensus-based, "proof-of-stake" form.

  var blogpost10 = '\n  <p class="firstparagraph">\n  Throughout the centralized-tech period of the\n  <i>mobile-powered </i> Web 2.0, most Sharing transactions take place on a centralized platform that simply facilitates\n  the peer-to-peer transactions. However, the trust is based on some third-party authority. For instance, Uber serves\n  as the centralalized, third-party authority between both consumers (whether resource-obtaining or resource-providing)\n  must place their trust. Similarly, centralized authorities like Paypal, etc. enable peer-to-peer collaboration.\n  Yet, the notion of trust remains unsolved: Both parties must place their faith in the third party. By definition,\n  this problem that undermines the\n  <i>Sharing Economy</i> is resolved by Blockchain technologies, through cryptography. Now, Decentralized Apps (DAPPS)\n  provide a truer sharing platform for value transactions.\n  </p>\n  <p>In short, neither peer,\n  <strong>neither consumer needs to be trusted, because both parties share a mutual trust in their shared ledger</strong>\n  (think of a thick book with an indexed log of each and every transaction, with unchangeable entries etched by cryptography.\n  In this fashion the forms of Exchange Value include:\n  <br /> 1. Value Funds &amp; Investments\n  <br /> 2. Immutable Insurance &amp; Risk Management\n  <br /> 3. Account for &amp; Audit Commodified Value 4. Authenticate &amp; Attest to Value\n  <br /> 5.

Sharing economy refers to both democratized peer-to-peer\n  marketplaces,\n  <i>and</i> collaborative, resource-circulating consumption systems where the consumer&#39;s role is provider or obtainer\n  of resources. By either sense, the\n  <i>Uberized</i> economy is made possible by the underlying platform of Decentralized Technologies. Mobile social media,\n  internet, and blockchain tech creates the conditions needed for a convenient, community-based transactions.</p>\n  \n  <p>Bitcoin and Ethereum crypto-contracts grab the headlines, however it is the very nature of blockchain&#39;s\n  <i>distributed, i.e. shared, </i>ledger that revolutionizes how humans interact, and how they exchange and share goods\n  and services. So, how might a transactional, zero-sum Market Economy merge with a Sharing Economy?</p>\n  \n  <p>In\n  <i>The Third Industrial Revolution, </i>Social and Economic theorist, Dr. Jeremy Rifkin, provides insight into how\n  the\n  <strong>Sharing Economy can grow alongside the traditional Market Economy</strong>.\n  <sup>1</sup> The theory argues three (3) breakthroughs are needed to create the conditions necessary for a new &quot;general\n  purpose technological platform,&quot; and thus an Industrial Revolution. They are management/commmunication of power,\n  sources of new power/energy, and the transportation of this power.</p>\n  \n  <p>The first condition: New forms of communication to\n  <i>manage</i> power, for example steam-powered printing press, trans-oceanic telegraph, then later telephone. The second\n  condition: New energy sources, for example steam-engine using coal and other fossil fuels. The third condition:\n  New methods to transport energy, i.e. the steam engine on rails, then later fossil fuel vehicles.</p>\n  \n  <p>So what&#39;s new about today? 5G Cellular technology coupled with decentralized, blockchain internet; Second, improving\n  solar &amp; wind power coupled with decentralized, bi-directional energy grid; and third, transporation by automatated,\n  driverless shipping for example. So, why is this important, even vital to adapt a new paradigm that fits the new\n  technology? exponential populstion growth and exponential climate changes are top of the list.</p>\n  \n  <p>Britain&#39;s innovations with steam &amp; coal characterized the first Industrial Revolution, and America&#39;s\n  innovations in telephones, oil-fueled vehicles, and centralized transportation grid, however the innovations in\n  the present era are much quicker than previous eras... which means we as a society can embrace more proactively\n  the New Paradigm needed to adapt.</p>\n  \n  <p>So, how can we change the way we\n  <i>think</i> and how we\n  <i>react</i> depends on our worldview, and how deeply entrenched. Thomas Kuhn&#39;s 2004 publication on\n  <strong>\n  <i>The Structure of Scientific Revolution</i>\n  </strong>\n  <sup>3</sup> explains how society will drag its feet in the face of change, and only after decades of controversy will\n  a New Paradigm Shift emerge.

Likewise, the telescope\n  has allowed us as a society to explore the outer universe and earth&#39;s position within it.</p>\n  \n  <p>Now, the inventions of machine-learning, computing coupled with Big Data analytics, allows us to explore (and manage)\n  a universe of knowledge--about\n  <i>ourselves</i>, human society--with unfathomably complex, unstructured relational data structures. Accessing the\n  data to computer-readable form is one thing, but meaning in data is inaccessible until the\n  <i>output</i> can be\n  <i>re-</i>programmed into meaningful, human-readable data, i.e. information. This latter stage of development is the\n  key challenge--for which success depends on representative female participation in Tech.</p>\n  \n  <p>Adding to the challenge of finding meaningful trends is the backdrop of noise from spurious variables. This is akin\n  to finding a needle in an increasingly complex and growing haystack.</p>\n  \n  <p class="quote">What&#39;s different now and has changed is it&#39;s no longer about taking this data, putting it into a computer\n  running a calculation and getting a balance sheet answer ...</p>\n  \n  <p class="quote">What&#39;s important now is what is the context of the data, what is it connected to, what effect is it having on\n  data around it...

  var blogpost4 = '<p class="firstparagraph">Germs present a timely topic for today, given the especially virulent\n  <strong>Flu Virus strain</strong>. Many, like me, have wondered why our 1940&#39;s-era\n  <sup>1</sup> technology in Flu Vaccine fabrication wouldn&#39;t invite more innovative solutions. Without feigning any\n  medical expertise, I have to still ask about the progress made with the ever-mutating--i.e., drifting--Flu virus&#39;\n  surface protein &quot;head,&quot; called hemaglutinin. This strategy &quot;guesses right&quot; very effectively,\n  and provides an effective solution for most, in most years. Yet this winter has revealed that effectiveness statistics\n  are\n  <i>not always</i> in our favor.</p>\n  \n  <p class="quote">For many decades, researchers believed the flu vaccine offered solid protection if it was a good match to the circulating\n  strains; studies from the 1940s through the 1960s routinely showed an efficacy of 70% to 90%. But those studies\n  relied on a misleading methodology.</p>\n  \n  <p class="quote">Danuta Skowronski, an epidemiologist at the BC Centre for Disease Control in Vancouver, Canada, instead blames mutations\n  in the vaccine strain itself. The most common influenza vaccine contains an &quot;inactivated&quot; virus, which\n  manufacturers grow in chicken eggs. As Skowronski&#39;s team first reported in 2014, the virus can mutate while\n  it is growing in the eggs, resulting in a vaccine unable to block circulating strains.\n  <sup>1</sup>\n  </p>\n  \n  <p>Earlier, I casually mentioned &quot;guessing&quot;, yet with great respect, the science behind estimating the flu\n  virus between the time of R &amp; D, fabrication, and the flu\n  <i>season</i>. (This antigenic drift, not to be confused with\n  <i>Antigenic Shift</i> in which the Flu Virus makes an abrupt change.) I&#39;ll let the CDC abbreviate this:</p>\n  \n  <p class="quote">One way they change is called &ldquo;antigenic drift.&rdquo; These are small changes in the genes of influenza viruses\n  that happen continually over time as the virus replicates. These small genetic changes usually produce viruses that\n  are pretty closely related to one another, which can be illustrated by their location close together on a phylogenetic\n  tree. Viruses that are closely related to each other usually share the same antigenic properties and an immune system\n  exposed to an similar virus will usually recognize it and respond\n  <sup>2</sup>.</p>\n  \n  <p>So, ultimately, the strategy is to estimate the form, location, of that virus--what it will look like--at a particular\n  period each year. This implicates a strategy to estimate the trajectory, stage by stage, of this virus, i.e. a longitudinal\n  time-series morphology, each year. The article makes this point more precise:</p>\n  \n  <p class="quote">But these small genetic changes can accumulate over time and result in viruses that are antigenically different (further\n  away on the phylogenetic tree). When this happens, the body&rsquo;s immune system may not recognize those viruses.\n  <sup>2</sup>\n  </p>\n  \n  <p>Petri dishes aside, let&#39;s focus on the changing nature of the Flu Virus, which makes itself a\n  <i>research </i>challenge in itself because of an ever-mutating object of study. Yet, this ever-changing nature also\n  provides the very tool Statisticians need most for estimating: Big Data. The Law of Large Numbers means that plain\n  math can accurately plot, and in most cases predict with a moderate statistical significance, future events, sort\n  of.</p>\n  \n  <p>Sort of I say because too often we predict that two separate events are more likely to occur, conditional on each\n  other, then conditional upon other factors. This being\n  <i>correlation</i>, but the Statistician&#39;s Holy Grail is the other kind: Causality. Causality hinges on only thre3e\n  things: 1) Association, 2) Time Precedence, and 3) Ruling out any\n  <i> effect</i> of spurious variables. (Hang with me, I&#39;m still getting back to the subject of our annual predictions\n  about a few months&#39; worth of antigenic drift.)</p>\n  \n  <p>Therefore, Big data, and new advances in the statistical sciences, and the technology that increasingly defines our\n  sciences, may soon refine and supercharge research into the first and third of the three points of causality. The\n  first of these, the associations, along the phylogenetic tree, are merely a network at its base, the science of\n  which gains computational strength each year. Rare as it is in Academia, in this case Might makes Right!</p>\n  \n  <p>\n  The third tenet of causality, after association and time direction, is ruling out the effect of other factors when separating\n  <i>cause</i> and consequence. Advances in managing big data, and statistical analysis of it, means gaining a better\n  handle on the multiple effects of\n  <sup>spurious </sup>factors, hence analysis optimized by new, network-graph data structure technology. The Law of Large\n  Numbers\n  <sup>3</sup>, i.e. the sheer number of mutations and other factors, coupled with new\n  <strong>technology</strong>, will better inform the morphology of the\n  <i>path</i> of the virus, along the phylogenetic tree itself. Who knows where a cure may come from, perhaps a bio-statistician\n  out there, churning the numbers, may be the one to stumble upon a better Flu Vaccine!\n  \n  </p>\n  <p>1.\n  <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/09/why-flu-vaccines-so-often-fail" target="_blank"> http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/09/why-flu-vaccines-so-often-fail </a>\n  </p>\n  \n  <p>2.\n  <a href="https://qz.com/1143420/the-2017-2018-flu-vaccine-is-less-effective-than-usual" target="_blank"> https://qz.com/1143420/the-2017-2018-flu-vaccine-is-less-effective-than-usual </a>\n  </p>\n  \n  <p>3.\n  <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/viruses/change.htm" target="_blank"> https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/viruses/change.htm </a>\n  </p>\n  ';

While excessive ads were one reason\nfor the heat generation, the main cause was that the phone&#39;s CPU was hijacked to mine for Monero.\n<sup>1</sup>\n</p>\n\n<p>The larger issue here is that the lines between trusted mobile-app authorities, i.e., certified by Play Store or\nApple&#39;s is increasingly irrelevent.

  var blogpost1 = '\n<p class="firstparagraph">I couldn&#39;t help but revisit the\n<strong>Environmental Sustainability</strong> problem I addressed in my February 28th post. This problem, experienced by\nthe top two crypto-currencies Bitcoin and Ethereum, is that the\n<i>monetary</i> value of the currency is matched to the\n<i>computing difficulty</i>--measured either by how much the computer is sweating, or by electricity KiloWatt Hours\nper year.\n<sup>1</sup> Digiconomist succinctly writes:</p>\n\n<p class="quote">The continuous block mining cycle incentivizes people all over the world to mine Bitcoin. As mining can provide a\nsolid stream of revenue, people are very willing to run power-hungry machines to get a piece of it. Over the years\nthis has caused the total energy consumption of the Bitcoin network to grow to epic proportions, as the price of\nthe currency reached new highs.\n<sup>2</sup>\n</p>\n\n<p>And, so the issue I&#39;m addressing is a side-effect of the deepening incentivization for miners to invest more\nequipment, and in turn, more electricity. The article goes on to report Bitcoin&#39;s surpassing 50 TeraWatt-Hours-per-year\nusage has surpassed that of Portugal and Singapore, which are 49.5 TWh per year, and 49.8 TWh per year, respectively.\nIn other words, the usage by the Bitcoin miner&#39;s cost (in electricity) compared with the miner&#39;s gain (in\nBitcoins accrued by incentivized mining) drives up and incentives a deeper Carbon Footprint.</p>\n\n\n<p class="quote">Fueled by a meteoric rise in the Bitcoin price over the past few months, the power usage of the Bitcoin network has\nbeen increasing at a feverish pace. Just a little over three months ago, at the start of November 2017, the Bitcoin\nEnergy Consumption Index was estimating the total electricity consumption of the Bitcoin network to be half of the\ncurrent amount. On the first day of November, the estimated consumption was equal to 24.3 TWh per year.\n<sup>1</sup>\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCarbon Footprint, measured in this way, equates as a double-edged sword: The miner&#39;s electricity costs account for approximately\n65% of the profit (Bitcoin units&#39; value, measured when mined). So the\n<i>economic </i>usage means the cheapest available fuel is part of the business model--and it would lead to the cost\nof the cheapest source of energy: Dirty Coal. At the end of the day, if the\n<i>currency&#39;s </i>rising value means that more computationally-intensive mining is more and more profitable, then\nperhaps the other edge looks preferred!\n</p>\n\n<p>1.\n<a href="\nhttps://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-electricity-consumption-surpasses-singapore-portugal\n" target="_blank"> https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-electricity-consumption-surpasses-singapore-portugal </a>\n</p>\n\n<p>2.\n<a href="\nhttps://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption\n" target="_blank"> https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption </a>\n</p>\n';

    <p class="firstparagraph">First, let me describe that blockchain technologies, i.e. Government contracts, Business contracts, Bitcoin and other
  
  cryptocurrencies, all rely on network graph theory, both on the low-level programming technology (peer-to-peer global
  
  ip networks) across the spectrum to high-level interfaces for institutional, corporate, individual needs and uses.
  
  These blockchain &quot;network&quot; analyses depend on highly variable--and simultaneous--network changes, node
  
  changes, and link changes; and, the latter three may arbitrarily change interdependantly or not.</p>
  
  
  
  <p>Therefore, blockchain technologies must first accomodate complex node variables for contracts (relationships) that
  
  include arbitrarily hierarchical mappings and conditional data structures. Secondly, blockchain tech must face analytical
  
  challenges that arise from informal practices
  
  <sup>1</sup>, by which the organizational nodes (employees) choose to deviate from the employee role&#39;s protocol for
  
  the sake of efficiency, convenience, company culture, and multiple other levels of human factors.</p>
  
  
  
  <p>Sociologists Meyer &amp; Rowan&#39;s (1977)
  
  <i>New Institutionalism</i> explains how employees change practices and decouple
  
  <i>actual</i> organizational structure from recorded rules, as a function of organizational size, time, convenience,
  
  etc. These continually new, unknown constraints on data must be intimately understood, non-algorithm human understanding
  
  <i>by at least one side </i>of the exchange. How do we recognize unwritten, soft rules and behaviors of a bank, a person,
  
  or a company&#39;s internal bot?</p> 
  
  <p>The hard sciences domain of Software Engineering, Computer Science, and Mathematics have brilliantly brought the
  
  world the blockchain tool, <s>for which</s> the Hard Sciences can and must share and propogate it's technical expertise <i>and higher standard of metric truth</i><s style="color:purple" class="strike-purple"> not contribute everything, especially relating with</s> to the other sciences that are still lagging behind--namely The Discipline of Sociology</s> toward acclimating to the modern age's social priorities and needs. Ask yourself, how well do 1,000 top blockchain-related programmers understand the multi-dimensional layers of hierarchical social, corporate, and governmental relationship networks--probably 700 of the 1,000. And how many social scientists can understand the technological sciences? Probably 200 out of 1,000. This means that <i>a chunk of the scientific displines suffer from acute innumeracy</i>. So how do we bridge this massive knowledge gap between qualitative meaning in the smart-contract.</p>
  
  <p>In the past, the layers of abstraction from raw technological tool to societal use was refined, improved, integrated through multiple layers of &quot;middlemen&quot;, such as lawyers, corporate lawyers, government institutions, non-governmental, non-profit and for-profit actors. Blockchain technology, by its very nature, erases the middlemen. Suddenly, one programmer, for example, is writing the same healthcare insurance crypto-contract, that last month an entire team of hospital employees spent a month writing; then overseeing and managing different facets of this same thing.</p>
  
  
  
  <p>However, the crypto-contract, once deployed to the blockchain, auto-manages the rest, forever or for the life of
  the contract. Therefore, rather than redoing the trials and errors of 200 years&#39; Sociology Network Analysts&#39;
  research and analytical development. Therefore, medical and other social fields cannot and should not turn to the
  Hard Sciences for solutions. These Med researchers and developers are already at home, safe within the academic
  domain of the Raw Sciences of Medical Sociology, Public Health, and so on. The next ten years of blockchain technology
  can either be defined by unwitting, piecemeal advances, accompanied by frequent, non-improving distastrous crises.
  Or, the next ten years can follow Sociology&#39;s Scientific Method toward a mildly turbulent, but stable and beautiful
  future.</p>
  
  
  
  <p>Examples aside, the <s>primacy</s> innumeracy of the Sociology academic field in the early 21st century quickly becomes apparent on
  
  review of the Sociologists&#39; specialization in network theories imbued with symmetrical and asymmetrical relationships,
  
  within social networks that change arbitrarily the direction, conditions, and values of those same relationships.
  
  <s>We</s> Sociologists deal with real-time, logical and hierarchical network mappings that appear arbitrary, yet are characterized by fixed patterns. This implies a higher level of competency to accurately judge a point-of-view without the ability to directly consult machine learning. <i>This is a Code or Be Coded moment in the sciences.</p>
  
  
  
  <p>No other academic field than sociology has advanced into the details, and endless network rabbit-holes that characterize societal behavior. Not until this second millenial decade could the marriage of Large Number Statistical Theory
  
  become consumated with the brilliance of early 1900&#39;s Sociological French Network Theories, like Maurice Halbswach&#39;s
  
  work on the clearly defined network patterns of a society&#39;s Collective Memory.</p>
  
  
  
  <p>No other academic field has collected and refined knowledge on network arbitrariness, such that Economic&#39;s &quot;irrational
  
  behaviors&quot; and Mathematical &quot;complexity models&quot; do not
  
  <i>touch to the bone</i> the meaning, the intersectionality of network analysis, which must incorporate simultaneous
  
  node changes (person gets job /or/ does not get job), network changes (All get jobs /or/ only 3 of 15 network groups
  
  get jobs), and most importantly the
  
  <i>relationship</i> changes (all jobs always useful /or/ half of job groups no longer useful) across time and fixed.</p>
  
  
  
  <p>Fine. So, why is Sociology&#39;s network theory so valuable beyond just the network insights gleaned from 19th and
  
  20th centuries&#39; network problems? Follow: European sociology came of age in the analog social era, while North
  
  American Sociology only recently come of age (Quebec in the 1960&#39;s [post-1968], U.S. in the 1990&#39;s[post-1999],
  
  in the digital social era. Therefore, the problem-solving patterns of past sociology are inherently small-data and
  
  more qualitative analysis, and thus only Sociology incorporates &quot;human-ness&quot; into the billion rows and
  
  columns of quantitative--numbers-only--analysis.</p>
  
  
  
  <p>For example, Oxford-developed S.I.E.N.A. Software accomplishes this task. SIENA--named for Simulation Investigation
  
  for Empirical Network Analysis--software calculates the real-time values, direction, and conditions of each relationship
  
  (link) in a network, simultaneously as each node, network, or alter-link changes or is changed; with this, it is
  
  possible to isolate directional, conditional
  
  <i>influence change</i> in real-time. Real-time sounds impossible, however, the SIENA documentation
  
  <sup >2</sup> describes its program algorithm to the statistical analysis of network data, with the focus on social networks.</p>
  
  
  
  <p>An easy example to grasp this is the concept of whether a person
  
  <i>self-selects </i>(e.g., due to subconscious leanings) into a group and thus matches to fruition the group&#39;s
  
  behavior with little group influence? Or does this same person join a group and emulates the group&#39;s behavior,
  
  by the group&#39;s influence over time. Sociological network analysis, using Snjder&#39;s SIENA software, achieves
  
  the impossible with the closed, directed graph networks that characterize blockchain technology. The network graph
  
  can be here understood as entire (complete) networks (i.e, the blockchain in its entirety without hard forks), not
  
  as personal (egocentered) networks: Using this SIENA model allows for the necessary assumptions that a set of nodes
  
  (social actors) is given, and all ties (links) between these nodes are known - except perhaps for a moderate amount
  
  of missing data</p>
  
  
  
  <p>If, and only if, this level of analysis may be achieved, the blockchain development may follow a linear, directed
  
  path of maturity with social and world needs. Until that time, that Sociology Network Theorists are called upon,
  
  blockchain developers will continue to bat their arms in the dark, stumbling over again the same bugs. Sadly, this
  
  semi-opaque future implicates the same fate as those that attempt to use blockchain for their currency, contract,
  
  and other societal needs--in this case, the blind would indeed lead the blind.</p>

  var blogpost16 = '\n  <p class="firstparagraph">There was once a time for App Developers that our habits followed our inner-philosophers--as an Esteemed Order of\nCoders--we held ourselves in the highest regard to separate form from function, and style from structural design.\nHence, in the early 2000&#39;s, a tri-partite, sensible world guided every web coder to abide by The scaffolding\nof HTML, functionality of JavaScript, and styling of CSS. A decade later, we must throw out this antiquated division\nof labor within web coding.</p>\n\n<p>Library modularization, (think JQuery, JSX, Bootstrap, etc.) within Javascript ES16 reveals that modules and components\nMust hold together CSS/HTML/JS, part by part. So, if a decade ago three teams handled html, js, css, it is now requisite\nto divide up 3 teams to 3 components (a team for the carousel widget, a team for the navigation widgets, and\n<i>\neach</i> of these component teams\n<strong>must</strong> be maintained together, not separately, the module&#39;s required html, js, css.</p>\n\n<p>This means that the new Division of Labour can no longer follow past patterns from 5 years ago. Otherwise, any and\nall coding will necessarily begin to &#39;reinvent the wheel.&#39; This is because any module, any library you go\nto, will\n<i>already</i> have its HTML pre-configured, JS pre-configured, CSS pre-configured. Thus, attempts to extricate new\ncss from one module to another (or worse yet, sharing css of modules), will only invite eventual misery, almost\ninstantly setting booby traps for the next coders upon arrival.</p>\n\n<p>So, where is the creativity? Where is the originality then? It is not gone. It has evolved to a higher level of abstraction,\nleaving to automation the boring stuff. So, if Vanilla JS is considered malpractice in the modern world, and if\nad-hoc JQuery is mocked and scoffed at by React coders, then where is creativity? If yesterday&#39;s craft was the\nhoisting of 15 javascript functions on each page, the New Art of modular coding is akin to a game of Tetris. Part\nby part, module by module, the modern coder open-source window-browses and window-shops; goes home, and cuts and\npastes, and folds and clips, then assembles and hangs to dry. Do Python programmers rewrite each particular module\ndefinition? That&#39;s absurd. Equally absurd is the javascript programmer that rewrites from scratch their modules.</p>\n\n<p>The esteemed Order of JavaScript Coders must wake up, and regain its work-load balance in this new age--an age that\neach year since 2014, the JavaScript language is rewritten, each year now, in both syntactic sugar and also fundamental\nstructure--especially the importing and exporting of modules. Therefore, philosophical Honor behooves each of us\nto a higher complexity, and a new commitment to, the &quot;Separation of Concerns.&quot; We can allow ourselves\na break, thankful for Progress, a progress by which we must\n<i>Stand on the Shoulders of Giants</i>, and Code-Create!</p>\n  ';

Rather, arbitrary mathematical forces created abnormal,\nnever-before-seen network structural density and symmetry patterns. Technological shifts were so efficient at multiplying\nand exacerbating misinformation because a curious sociological network phenomenon rendered parts of our daily social\nlearning and acculturating process to network forces out of our own control.</p>\n\n<p>A January 2016 American Sociology Association Newsletter Editorial\n<sup> 2</sup> from Sally T. Hillsman, in which she explained how the social mechanisms of our own misinformation were\nnot entirely within our own control to resist. In fact, the arbitrary (often random) social structural changes from\nhigher social-media hours, create an arbitrary social network structure whose links (in their content and influence)\nbegin to dominate over nodes (each of us). In other words, the sway of trends and opinionated critical thought becomes\ndominated by the relationships, e.g., the &quot;likes&quot; and &quot;shares&quot;, leading to a statistically natural\npropensity toward homogeneity--a.k.a. group-think. The mechanism is akin to peacefully swimming close and parallel\nto the coastline, and (due to random coastal floor structure), a rip-tide suddenly ships you far out to sea--a fatal\nand tragic fate rendering experienced swimmers out of their own control. Same principle with an arbitrary\n<i>underlying and unseen</i> network structure.</p>\n\n<p>Our social network structures always are prone to continual shift, and so the usual &quot;interruptions&quot; that\npreviously stopped this inward shift soon began to disappear. Hillsman explains:</p>\n\n<p class="quote">Lies, half-truths, and misinformation spread so rapidly across the public through digital communication that the\ntimespan for thoughtful, effective correction or rebuttal is infinitesimal. Because of confirmation Bias, misinformation\nand outright lies quickly strengthen preconceived truths or pre-held beliefs that are already hard to change.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, even though we all have been pointedly warned,\n<i> none of us</i> without advanced sociological analysis skills could understand that a curious network phenomonenon--ultimately\ndriven by some arbitrary mathematical calculation involving size, density, symmetry, conditional influences, and\nthe strength of ties outweighing network nodes. For the reasons of these factors, our social inclinations were\n<i>out of our control</i> -- no, but really, this time they were!</p>\n\n<p>And so, we can learn from Sociology what steps to take in order to counteract random, but risky, network phenomena\n-- because nobody likes to go for a swim at the beach, and unwittingly get shipped out to sea!</p>\n\n<p class="footnotes">1.

Sure, it&#39;s more\nof a &quot;metropolitan&quot; phenomenon; and sure, it&#39;s become an accepted global platform--along with myriad\nother crypto-currencies, but it&#39;s exchange-worthiness remains shrowded, and misunderstood by many. Cryptocurrencies\nare useful as a vehicle for investment, and yes, there are Bitcoin millionaires due to the currency&#39;s rise to\nfame with last year&#39;s increase in value (from $1,000 to ~$20,000) etc., etc. But, so far its contributions,\nuses, fame are one-sidedly\n<i>macro-</i>economic. A recent CNET article\n<sup>1</sup>, among others, documents miniscule (and not improving) percentage of\n<i>actual</i> use at the &quot;cash-registers&quot; of society.</p>\n\n<p>Is there something wrong with such little micro-economic usage? Not at all! According to general sociological\n<i>Early Adopter</i> theory--based on Everett M. Rogers&#39;\n<i>Diffusion of Innovations</i>\n<sup>2</sup>--the timeline of the Innovation Adoption Lifecycle is fairly ordinary. That is, the Roger&#39;s bell curve\nranges from the beginning innovators, to early adopters, early majority, and late majority. However, the blockchain\narticles always miss the point. Currencies are more of a distraction compared to the genuine usefulness for the\nevery-person, in every-day affairs, on a given day--i.e., micro-economic use.</p>\n\n<p>The true value, the kind that makes our lives easier on any given day, and for the every-person, is\n<i>not</i> the currency, it is the contract, that allows for individualized, targeted sharing of specific information--whether\nfinancial, governmental, or any other centralized database. An example is in order before I continue, since we can\nall relate to the risk of using a credit or debit card, the risk most notably concerning Target store credit card\nhacks a couple years ago.</p>\n\n<p>Suppose a person shops at 3 different retailers, using a different credit card for each. For these 3 transactions,\nthis person had only needed to provide two discrete pieces of information about themselves for each transaction:\nthey prove they have the $27, $200, and $5; and they prove a third party(i.e.,CC or bank)will make that $27, $200,\nor $5 available, if their client agrees. Instead, for each transaction, they open their\n<i>entire</i> financial information, and can only hope that law-enforcement will prevent cyber-theft; and if the store&#39;s\ndatabases are hacked, then tough-luck!</p>\n\n<p>Crypto-contracts provide the technology for this individualized, risk-free transaction, rather than for each transaction,\nproviding the generalized information for individual transaction. Highly inefficient! Nobody thinks to walk around\nwith their life-savings in cash, then at the 7-11 store, to open their wad of cash and peel out a bill. The credit\ncard system, blessed as it is, did not previously have technology to avoid this very thing. So, financial institutions\nhave had to rely on the many layers of security, passwords, pins, mothers&#39; maiden names, etc. Then, based on\nthe mathematics behind prime numbers, they hope to keep your money safe in one, centralized spot--with a bright\nred target on it.</p>\n\n<p>Now, the crypto-contract provides this decidedly *micro-economic* experience for the everyday person. And that, my\nfriends, has nothing to do with crypto-currencies. There is no micro-economic value in crypto-currency, instead\nthe crypto-\n<i>contract</i> is the true, unsung hero, and a hero we will all get to know. [personal opinion - this hero&#39;s name\nis the Ethereum Virtual Machine]. In any case, Crypto-contracts provide this ability to provide pinpointed,\n<i>specific, targeted information</i> as citizens, too. When we provide our drivers license number, for the sake of\nrenting that car, we provide every aspect of information of ourselves to Hertz. They don&#39;t need this.

  var blogpost10 = '\n  \n<p class="firstparagraph">7 Ethereum-based technological features offer us a new world -- a decentralized new world, not dependent on the centralized\nservers and bandwidth of Instagram, Comcast, T-Mobile, Amazon, Google, etc. With that statement ends general consensus among blockchain\nexperts, pundits, and authors. However, if the current logistical obstacles provide controversy and competing algorithms\nover sustainability, security, and scalability, then they reveal much more about the general pathway of social uses\n(and potential effects) than they hide. In my February 15th\n<a href="#18-02-15">blog</a>, I touched on a few features of micro-economic uses so as to distinguish the more certain aspects of the\ncrypto-contract horizon.</p>\n\n<p>\n<strong>Prologue</strong>\n</p>\n\n<p>So, what are some core features of block-chain technology that affect the quality of our lives, and the\n<i>productivity</i> of our work as a society of academics, public-sector and private-sector professionals? First, a\nlittle background and context before I outline seven blockchain functionalities. The Ethereum blockchain helps distinguish\nitself--and its blockchain-native language Solidity--from earlier tech, like Bitcoin and other Proof of Work-based\nblockchains. Ethereum blockchain offers a syntax and programming features, e.g. &quot;looping&quot;, &quot;recursion&quot;,\nwith the full power of a\n<i>Turing Complete</i> language--that is, given enough resources, the language can solve any programmable problem.</p>\n\n<p>More background and a clarifying metaphor are in order: The Bitcoin blockchain transaction resembles the accounting\nsystem of a foos-ball table point rack with a basic calculator glued to the side. In contradistinction, An Ethereum\nblockchain transaction would resemble a network of computers,\n<i>which is itself,</i> a computer--hence, the name Ethereum Virtual Machine. This allows for Quickbooks to calculate\ninto a PDF to be sent via an email contract-signing program. Much more useful!</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, Ethereum&#39;s Blockchain is more than a networked, chained list of blocks, like Bitcoin. The Ethereum\nblockchain is actually a &quot;Virtual Machine&quot;, like a a big networked &quot;home computer&quot;. The native\nlanguage of the blockchain, Solidity, allows for an\n<i>application binary interface</i>, ABI. So, for example, I can type up an Ethereum contract on my home computer,\nthen directly access by command line the blockchain itself. In layman&#39;s terms, the manner that modern-day app,\nfor example Instagram, is a centralized API (Application Programming Interface) that allows one programming system\nto interact with another, such as Instragram offers a &quot;sharing API&quot; that connects to hardware contacts,\nthus facitilating communicating with third-party aplications, like sharing your instagram picture to your Facebook\naccount, via your T-Mobile phone&#39;s contacts list. This API relationship broadly describes the modern world we\nlive in, wherein a Chryser driving system exchanges API information with your T-Mobile Bluetooth network system,\nwhich exchanges API information with your own contact list, and so on, and our lives are made easier.</p>\n\n<p>So, are we out of the woods? Has Ethereum solved the blockchain question? Yes, if it were the 1920 pre-relativity\ndays; However, with the advent of quantum computing, potential security vulnerabilities immediately arise. The reason\nbeing that digital math uses binary &quot;on/off&quot; calculations, while quantum math implicates a tertiary,\n<i>qubit</i> &quot;simultaneous states&quot;. Therefore, we have now entered the 3rd generation of blockchain technology,\nboth programmable, but also quantum-proof due to mathematical graph features. For example, IOTA&#39;s blockchain\ndesign utilizes a\n<i>Winternitz One-Time Signature</i>, by which one&#39;s transaction is entered into with a private-key, and the blockchain\nmoreso resembles a &quot;Tangle&quot; of a directed graph, which allows for computational &quot;states&quot;. IOTA\nrecently garnered criticism in January 2018 due to an unfortunate crypto-hack, that exposed an apparent vulnerability.\nIn truth, this was a case of user-error because users were\n<i>re-using</i> their one-time keys, which significantly decreases security to the point that a home computer could\ncrack the code! I choose to not digress further, and quantum computing is not quite advanced enough now to cause\ndamage, but in the future could potentially split the blockchain in two, or other quantum possibilities.</p>\n\n<p>In sum, the technical obstacles change each month, however one must not lose sight of the forest for the trees. Social\nuseablity, potential scope and of course unintended consequences have all finally begun to emerge, at least in form,\nwith little difference between the 2nd generation blockchain or the 3rd generation Patrician directed graph blockchain.\nThe underlying principle of the blockchain&#39;s micro-economic utiliity through crypto-\n<i>contracts</i> is the same, as opposed to plain crypto-currency. you know the usual bartering solutions for Supply\n&amp; Demand leading to Economics Game Theory, etc. This is where we must take our leave of the Hard Sciences of\nMathematics, and enter the realm of Sociology, Psychology, Anthropology and Economics.</p>\n  ';
  var blogpost9 = '\n  <p class="firstparagraph">The guiding light through the centuries of scientific paradigms, in the Kuhnian sense\n<sup >1</sup>, have derived from deductive ideas from above - whether priestly or royal decree. Then, the primacy of the\n<i>Scientific Method</i> from the Renaissance forward--punctuated first by Copernican Heliocentrism, then other Paradigm\nShifts--has directed rational and ethical norms in each respective period, e.g. Enlightenment authors of 17th, 18th\ncentury. Fast forward to the modern period, wherein the current era&#39;s emerging paradigm holds Sharing as a collective-priority\nand responsibility, then an amazing philosophical moment.\n<i>Historical Materialism</i>\n<sup>2</sup> prescribes what is directly here a novel Paradigm Shift by which authority is not derived from governmental,\nfinancial sources, but rather the\n<i>shared</i>societal consensus about cryptographic, mathematical proofs as true authority. Further, the revolutionary\nshift also innately provides tools for implemention through decentralized, programmable data-sharing. Cryptography\nhas in a sense become a\n<i>de jure</i> middle-person for identification and verification of property.</p>\n\n<p>\n<strong>I. Protecting rights through immutable records</strong>\n<br /> Inalieable Rights can now be identified and verified by the cryptographic authority of a mathematical proof, rather\nthan exclusively through governmental or financial institutions from above. The modern period also has held this\ndecentralized, individual authority as the\n<i>a priori</i> starting points for philosophical proofs. Premises about truth begin with the conditions of humankind,\nnot idealogies. In fact, it was the\n<i>Young Hegelians</i> of early 19th century Vienna &amp; Berlin, who ushered in the Modern Era of Western Philosophy,\nby laying out Truth as inverted, beginning from the empirical &quot;ground&quot; upward. This &quot;upside-down\ntree&quot; defines philosophical modernity. Jean-Paul Sartre wrote that the whole of\n<i>Existentialism</i> and 20th century philsophy is a mere subset, and never escapes Continental Materialism, as argued\nin Sartre&#39;s\n<i>Search for a Method</i>.\n<sup>3</sup>\n</p>\n\n<p>All of the Sciences, prodded by this Truth of Empiricism, followed suit through all the tech innovations since Hegel.\nI&#39;m so surprised by this, because for me, the role of cryptography is shocking on two levels. First, cryptography\nresemblees philosophy rather than the Empiricism that I had envisioned would govern social rule (Some once thought\nnuclear sciences held this role--no longer! Mathematics takes the crown. Secondly, I&#39;m still dumbfounded that\na Paradigm Shift\n<i>first</i> offers the tools to fulfill itself? Staggering to consider the arbitrary changes ahead for a society that\nis provided the tools of social structural change first, but how quite convenient!</p>\n\n<p>\n<strong>II. Bureaucratic Atomization in a True Sharing Economy</strong>\n</p>\n\n<p>It is satisfyingly reassuring to see the good-natured, altruistic efforts among the thousands, upon thousands of\nopen-source volunteers, and blockchain innovators, like Vitalik Buterin author of Ethereum Virtual Machine, whose\naims and efforts make staggering progress each quarter. The potential for removing the &quot;middle-person&quot;\nfrom the day-to-day, micro-economic &quot;cost of living&quot;. This goes for for the exchanging of titles, legal\ndocuments, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Sharing of Resources is, in my personal opinion, critical to global future--both out of increasing necessity in allocating\nincreasingly limited resources; an arbitrary rearrangement of\n<i>Social Structure</i> and distribution of its resources. While the exponential population growth looms on the near\nhorizon, a clear, pre-existing solution begins with a focus on\n<i>smart</i>, effective sharing of resources. The driving principle of sustainability is made convenient by means of\nblockchain technology, extending for example to local economies, cooperatives, ride-sharing, etc.</p>\n\n<p>\n<strong>III.

The existing remittance system (not speaking\nto\n<i>centralized</i>, middle-man alternatives like PayPay, etc.)--supposing if I wire $2 Loonie to a Canadian friend&#39;s\nCanadian Bank--requires payments executed through two separate bank transactions in two national payments systems,\nthus the sending country and receiving country each take a cut.

And so, our own behavior, coupled with our networks&#39; behavior,\ncoupled with predictive analytics--this represents a wealth of information beyond our attributed or inherited traits.\nThe programming is\n<i>in</i> the data, however, citizens have become less and less involved, ceding app by centralized app our own information\nand ensuring profit to 3rd party marketers.

With all our technology, we just can&#39;t wait to hear the latest\ngossip about sister Becky&#39;s Boyfriend&#39;s Brother&#39;s Friend that\n<i>also</i> got to meet Shakira. Gossip to one person is a valuable asset to the data analyst.

Thanks to classificatorial wisdom of AI &amp; plain machine-learning?</p>\n\n<p>These relational queries are simply too difficult for relational, row &amp; column SQL data structures. In fact,\nmany queries are impossible, due to unprescient database schema architectures. Next, with the need to &quot;objectify&quot;\ndata into non-relational objects, rather than an antiquated, rigid row-and-column design. Thus, the second major\ntype of data structure is more flexible and adept in finding these relational queries that are ever more in vogue.\nHowever, the crystal-like, pristine non-relational, No-SQL designs quickly turn to spaghetti, and are poor for scalability.\nBetween a rock and a hard place, a third data structure has emerged in recent years.</p>\n\n<p>Graph Data Structures\n<sup>2</sup> allow data queries that had otherwise been impossible to capture in an entity relationship diagram. The\nideal example to clarify is the manner that the Swiss banks&#39; accounts were discovered to be hiding vast amounts\nof hidden taxes, etc. The cover-up was so well-constructed that not until new, graph database queries discovered\npatterns of money flow\n<sup>1</sup>:</p>\n\n<p class="quote">The data was then turned into a graph format to detect then fine-tune the connections between the nodes.

  var blogpost6 = '\n  <p class="firstparagraph">While I&#39;ve had blockchain-related topics on the mind lately, it seems I can&#39;t escape it as I broach new fields--blockchain\n  is everywhere! Well, I had begun my blog with intentions about the accelerated speed of language and syntax formation,\n  and the curious phenomenon I&#39;d call, for lack of a better word or or my own reading, &quot;declarative-syntax-merging&quot;.\n  This involves the curious, and largely unknown, growth of JavaScript scripting language into almost every domain\n  of web apps, data analysis, and even the bounds of\n  <i>Logic</i> itself. Though I won&#39;t submit my readers to a history of a language, suffice it to say that, &quot;If\n  a certain algorithm, device, or object is programmable, then it will eventually be programmed in JavaScript.&quot;</p>\n  \n  <p>Without getting into technicals, I&#39;ll instead use a perfect metaphor--the manner by which English merged with\n  French, beginning with the conquests of William of Normandy, around 1096 onward. Almost a thousand years later,\n  we can see how English grammar inherited it&#39;s Anglo-Saxon Linguistic roots, along with the core vocabulary;\n  Then, as English vocabulary moves past the first few thousand core words, e.g. &quot;milk&quot; or &quot;house&quot;\n  from &quot;melche&quot; or &quot;haus&quot;, then more than 70% of English Vocabulary is directly inherited from\n  French, e.g. &quot;lactose&quot; or &quot;mansion&quot; from &quot;lait&quot; or &quot;maison&quot;.</p>\n  \n  <p>Similarly, the language of the web and original browsers, JavaScript, has similarly morphed into a new language called\n  Solidity, but in only a micro-fraction of English&#39;s time. The usual FOMO logic propels coding language use,\n  for example FOMO induced Microsoft&#39;s flagship Text Editor, Visual Code, to adopt it years ago.\n  <sup >1</sup> The language of Ethereum Blockchain is Solidity, which like the above example, has two parents, one non-legitimate.\n  It is in all respects totally JavaScript, yet with object-oriented elements of C++. For the layperson, let&#39;s\n  just say Solidity resembles a &quot;Liger&quot;, in it is at it&#39;s core JavaScript, yet with increasing sophistication\n  based on C++ logic, its head and torso has begun to resemble the powerful machine-code of C++ ever more. And it\n  is a beautiful, but curious phenomonenon.</p>\n  \n  <p>\n  <a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/microsoft-adds-ethereum-language-solidity-visual-studio-1552171">http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/microsoft-adds-ethereum-language-solidity-visual-studio-1552171</a>\n  </p>\n \n  ';

So much so, the US Department of Labor forecasts U.S. citizens will be able to fill 39% of those positions;\n  there are not enough Immigration visas (especially in the Trumpian era of isolationism) to make up the rest.</p>\n  \n  <p>&nbsp;</p>\n  \n  <p>So, how is it that only 14% of females in the entire field of cybersecurity? Silicon Valley is, at its best, obscenely\n  one-sided. At Google, only 17% of the company&#39;s tech jobs are filled by women. Facebook women staff only 15%\n  of tech jobs, and Twitter? 10% female.

This literacy\n  of the Current Era is akin to the 26-letter alphabet of written sentences and paragraphs, and--not to be taken for\n  granted--is the exclusive form of communication, outside of a 100-foot perimeter, up until 150 years ago. Knowledge\n  is not power, the communication of knowledge is power.\n  \n  <p>&nbsp;</p>\n  \n  <p>I argue that today, the power is to program one application programming interface (API) to talk to another API. In\n  other words, the ability to directly communicate with software at the command-line is not now a requisite skill,\n  but promotions would not escape this necessity! So, now reverting back to the subject of women in tech, American\n  leadership is in deep peril without more female insight.

Amazing, and the two occurred nearly simultaneously\n  as I worked on them, their paths crossed and poof, gone! Same platform, and I paid the price! Whether I change my\n  ways is yet to be seen, but I shall continue with my original theme for the day, namely, Sustainability, a.k.a.\n  Carbon Footprint.</p>\n  \n  <p class="quote">Power consumption is one of the major costs of bitcoin mining, as dedicated machines crunch the algorithms that build\n  a record of every single bitcoin transaction and are rewarded with tiny fractions of a bitcoin for their efforts.\n  <sup >1</sup>\n  </p>\n  \n  <p>Today I have a mild Critique and Praise for the blockchain sustainability problem caused by sky-high electricity\n  bills! Computer algorithms do waste electricity, not like your Widescreen. More electricity is gobbled up by small\n  and large mining operations in nearly every country than small nations!\n  <sup >1</sup>. Ethereum, Bitcoin and a handful of other &quot;Proof-of-Work&quot; designs require electricity because\n  the investment in equipment itself is investment, but more importantly, two-way incentivation for mining drives\n  the system, and the scarcity demand through difficulty computations.</p>\n  \n  <p>So, is the electricity consumption really\n  <i>correlated</i> with the value, scarcity, of the currency? Yes. Digiconomist--a cryptocurrency analysis site\n  <sup\n  id="digiconomist">3</sup> estimates\n  <i>each</i>Ethereum transaction represents a 45 Kilowatt-hour of electricity&#39;s mining.

According to\n  <i>Digiconomist</i>, an average household&#39;s Carbon Footprint is about 10 tons of CO2 per year. The article does\n  the math for us very succinctly:</p>\n  \n  <p class="quote">On top of this, we can find that the process of mining Bitcoin isn&rsquo;t just more energy-intensive, but also has\n  a bigger environmental impact. To reach that conclusion, we first need to estimate the carbon footprint for both.\n  For Bitcoin we can, again, get this number from the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index. For gold, we assume a carbon\n  footprint of 20 tons of CO2e per every kilogram of gold mined\n  <sup >3</sup>.</p>\n  \n  <p>The article continues to clarify that 33,000 kilograms of CO2 per unit mines (comparatively, one Bitcoin&#39;s worth\n  of Gold is 4,000 kilograms of CO2). At the end of the day, the electricity costs--if not sustainable long-term--could\n  spell trouble.

Then, we have my trusty Dell (actual) Tower with 16 Gigs of RAM, 2-terabytes, etc. that\nalso seems to need an extra fan to stay cool--probably the sustainability of 100 Raspberry computers. My entire\ncarbon footprint changes more with the electrical products that I use, than my vehicle! Well, I also confess my\nJeep Cherokee can&#39;t even boast 20 miles per hour ... oops, conscience pangs, ouch ... Well, hypocritical, slightly,\nbut found not guilty since I&#39;m a bike-commuter for life!</p>\n';
  var blogpost1 = '\n<p class="firstparagraph">Environmental Sustainability, again, and a higher-level view of the dilemmea...I couldn&#39;t resist:\n<br /> Bitcoin&#39;s Initial Coin Offering was 2011 or so, then Ethereum, with Ether for currency was 2015; These two,\never so prescient designs, also have their Achilles Heal. These two are\n<strong>&quot;Proof of Work&quot; currency algorithsms</strong>. This means that the &quot;Demand&quot; side of supply-and-demand,\nderives from\n<i>difficulty levels</i> of crypto-blocks to mine. So, miners are incentivized to spend $1500 on a semi-mediocre-good\nmining rig (which is basically 20 NVIDIA Graphics Cards tied together to stack of two-by-fours with lots of fans\n... erhem, sustainability?...</p>\n\n<p>And for each block that is &quot;solved&quot;, hence the block being validated, and somebody&#39;s cryptocurrency\npurchase/transaction is resolved! (takes about 12 minutes for the whole global blockchain to cycle, and Ethereum\nis less than a minute). So, the whole cycle continues, churning through coal- and carbon-stained hands of the electricity\nfed to these crypto-mining rigs\n<sup>1</sup>. For many it&#39;s a hobby, like the British Hobbyists&#39; love for ham- and short-wave radio setups, yet\nthis profitable, yet particular hobby resembles the 1870&#39;s coal factory smoke stacks in South London!</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s face it, if Ethereum is able to successfully hard-fork to a Proof-of-Stake system soon--and Vitalik Buterin\nand his crew assure us it is coming\n<sup>2</sup>--then great--problem solved, everything eventually converts to Ethereum. If\n<i>not</i>they face an existential threat. Because, in a more enlightened ten years from now, those mining depots\n<i>would</i> look like unfettered factory smoke-stacks. Proof-of-Stack, whose currency value is not set to difficult\nof algorithm puzzle (hence,\n<i>proof-of-work</i>, but rather to ownership of &quot;voting pools&quot;, which is a\n<i>\n<strong>Consensus-Based Blockchain algorithm</strong>\n</i> [Complex subject best reserved for a rainy day, or better yet, no day! I may revisit this alternative in a funner\nway, here&#39;s a glimpse from Vitalk&#39;s @VitalikButerin tweet yesterday:</p>\n\n<p class="quote">Question for mathematicians: is there a assumed-to-be-normal number (ie. digits are random, like pi or e) where you\ncan calculate the nth digit in log(n) (or even polylog(n)) time? If so, then H(x) = digits[x ... x+100] seems like\nit would be a cool cryptographic hash algo.</p>\n\n<p>Now, I am by no means a detective, but by the sound of those tweets, the Proof-of-Work algorithm seems to still be\nof utmost importance ...</p>\n\n<p>1.\n<a href="https://blockexplorer.com/news/ethereum-launches-casper-testnet-paving-way-proof-stake/" target="_blank">https://blockexplorer.com/news/ethereum-launches-casper-testnet-paving-way-proof-stake/</a> and also,\n<a href="https://www.trustnodes.com/2017/11/28/ethereums-proof-stake-casper-testnet-nears-launch"\ntarget="_blank">https://www.trustnodes.com/2017/11/28/ethereums-proof-stake-casper-testnet-nears-launch</a>\n</p> \n\n<p>Copyright &copy; 2018 All Rights Reserved. &nbsp; | &nbsp;\n<a href="http://www.thomasmaestas.net" title="Contact Information: thomasmaestas.net/">\n  thomasmaestas.net</a>&nbsp; | &nbsp;\n<img src="dist/img/paypal.PNG" alt="PayPal Emblem" height="\n15"></img>\n<a href="https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/ThomasMaestas" style="color:white;text-decoration:none;">\n  &nbsp; Blog Support Appreciated!</a>\n</p>\n';
