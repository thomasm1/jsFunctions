But although the proofs are new, they do not pass the test of exciting the mathematical mind. It’s the same for powerful algorithms, which can generate convincing short-form text, but are a long way from writing a novel.\n<br/><br /> \nBut in 2021 I think we will see – or at least be close to – an algorithm with the ability to write its first mathematical story. Storytelling through the written word is based on millions of years of human evolution, and it takes a human many years to reach the maturity to write a novel. But mathematics is a much younger evolutionary development. A person immersed in the mathematical world can reach maturity quite quickly, which is why one sees mathematical breakthroughs made by young minds.\n<br/><br />\nThis is why I think that it won’t take long for an AI to understand the quality of the proofs we love and celebrate, before it too will be writing proofs. Perhaps, given its internal architecture, these may be mathematical theorems about networks – a subject that deserves its place on the shelves of the mathematical libraries we humans have been filling for centuries.\n\n<sup>1</sup>\n  </p>\n ",

This framework offers high-level abstractions for the design and training of both discriminative and generative quantum models under TensorFlow and supports high-performance quantum circuit simulators. We provide an overview of the software architecture and building blocks through several examples and review the theory of hybrid quantum-classical neural networks. We illustrate TFQ functionalities via several basic applications including supervised learning for quantum classification, quantum control, and quantum approximate optimization. Moreover, we demonstrate how one can apply TFQ to tackle advanced quantum learning tasks including meta-learning, Hamiltonian learning, and sampling thermal states. We hope this framework provides the necessary tools for the quantum computing and machine learning research communities to explore models of both natural and artificial quantum systems, and ultimately discover new quantum algorithms which could potentially yield a quantum advantage.\n    <sup>3</sup>\n</p> \n   ",

Mr. LaFrazia, a 54-year-old Air Force veteran, recalled spending hours poring over an online list of tariff codes to figure out which applied to his parts. When he called the manufacturers, they often didn’t know where they fell in the government’s taxonomy of tradable goods.

China is constructing a $10 billion research center for quantum applications. The European Union announced in 2016 that it is creating a €1 billion effort on four areas of quantum technology including computing and communication.\n\nMr. Krishna, who also oversees the integration of IBM’s $33 billion acquisition of Red Hat Inc. said he expects the deal—IBM’s largest acquisition to date—to close around June. The company has received approval from the U.S. Department of Justice for the deal, and is now awaiting approval from the European Union.\n<br /><br />\nAsked about restructuring after the acquisition is completed, Mr. Krishna said that it wouldn’t result in any job cuts at Red Hat.\n“This is a value deal, not about cost synergy. They [Red Hat] run on multiple public clouds. It’s got to be preserved,” he said.\nIn the public cloud space, IBM trails rivals Amazon Inc. and Microsoft Corp. IBM ranked fifth in the world for public cloud-infrastructure service in 2017, according to data from Gartner Inc., behind Amazon, Microsoft, Alibaba Group Holding Inc. and Google Inc.\n<br /><br />\nBut Mr. Krishna said the acquisition creates a big opportunity for IBM to expand in the so-called hybrid cloud space where customers run some software in their own data centers but also use cloud services.  “I’m not trying to catch up to Amazon and Microsoft,” he said. “They are going down the path of public cloud and we are going to be hybrid. There is so much investment that’s already happening and there is so much data that can’t sit on the public cloud. I believe there is space for all of us,” he said. <sup>1</sup></p>\n  ",

However, the once belittled simple, but reliable, distributed blockchain ledger leverages third-party smart contracting:\n  </p>\n \n<p class=\"quote\">\nEthereum has become the most popular blockchain for creating smart contracts. One of the major design goals of the Ethereum platform was to support smart contracts. From the start, this set Ethereum apart from Bitcoin, which was created first and foremost as a digital currency platform.\n<br /><br />\nAs the Bitcoin protocol has evolved, it has gained support for smart contracts. Smart contract functionality is not as programmable and extensible on Bitcoin as it is on Ethereum. However, using features added to Bitcoin through improvement proposals, certain smart contract functionality can be achieved through Bitcoin scripting.\n<br /><br />\nFor Particl, the most important smart contract feature in Bitcoin is the OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY opcode, which was introduced by Peter Todd as Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 65. The opcode makes it possible to write scripts that prevent funds in a multi-signature wallet from being spent until a certain signature pattern is implemented or a certain amount of time passes.<sup>1</sup></p>\n",

The lawsuit accuses Wright of fraud and theft of “over $11 billion worth of bitcoins and intellectual property from the estate of Dave Kleiman and W&K shortly after Dave’s 2013 death.” Last week the court ordered Wright to disclose bitcoin addresses that belonged to him before December 2013. The Florida Magistrate overseeing the lawsuit, Judge Bruce Reinhart, signed the order and gave Wright a few days to produce the list.\n  <br /><br />\n  Since then a list of addresses that were once filed in an obscure fashion was unsealed and Wright claims to have mined the first 70 bitcoin blocks starting from the Genesis block. After the redacted list was unsealed, the researchers at Wizsec decided to study the addresses and wrote a blog post about the recently disclosed file. Wizsec claims that Wright simply copied and pasted the addresses from the first 70 blocks and asserted the addresses belonged to him without any cryptographic proof.\n<br /><br />\nWizsec says the motion begs the belief that the self-proclaimed inventor acts as if he is “ignorant about the fundamentals of his invention.” “Perhaps Wright thinks that being a bitcoin miner means pointing at bitcoins and yelling ‘Mine,’” the researchers jokingly remarked. In the document, Wright’s filing continues to assert that he did not keep track of which Bitcoin blocks he mined and that he does not know any of the other Bitcoin public addresses. The motion further states that the self-styled Satoshi does not have a complete list of the public addresses that he owned as of any date.<sup>1</sup>\n</p>\n",

Despite the quantum-directed molecular behavior of biological organisms, the classical exponentiation of machine-learning statistical algorithms still does work miracles:  \n  </p> \n  \n  <p class=\"quote\"> \n  Studies indicate that using algorithms to analyze digital slides delivers diagnoses as accurate as an expert pathologist—and in some instances, the algorithms are more accurate. A 2018 study by Massachusetts General Hospital and MIT found that an automated system they developed diagnosed dense breast tissue (an indicator of breast cancer) in mammograms at the same level as an expert radiologist. Another algorithm developed by Google was found to “help detect metastatic breast cancers with significant accuracy and improve pathologist performance,” according to studies in the Archives of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine and the American Journal of Surgical Pathology.\n  </p>\n  So, how can we best take advantage of these advances? Clear the brush! The meta-organization of healthcare technology and financing simply can't keep pace with the pure tech:\n  <p class=\"quote\">\n  After taking a look, the pathologist might ship it to a specialist at another lab for a second opinion. Each time the slide is moved, it is packed up and shipped to a different address. All the while, you’re waiting days or even weeks to hear whether or not you have cancer.\n<br /><br />\n  For decades, there have been limited ways to share medical slides, with information management lagging behind even as medical science advanced. But in the past few years, a new industry of digital pathology has emerged that could finally offer a more efficient and large-scale way of distributing and analyzing these kinds of samples.\n  <sup>1</sup>\n  </p>\n  <p>So, the good news from <i>the doctors'</i> occasional nemesis, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, decided that after 8 years of trials and hearings, truly scalable and sufficiently large sample data can now be digitized - hence personalizing the law of large numbers from the whole to the individual patient.

Waste experts call the system of dumping all the recyclables into one bin “single-stream recycling.” It’s popular. But the cost-benefit math of it has changed. The benefit — more participation and thus more material put forward for recycling — may have been overtaken by the cost — unrecyclable recyclables. On average, about 25 percent of the stuff we try to recycle is too contaminated to go anywhere but the landfill, according to the National Waste and Recycling Association, a trade group. Just a decade ago, the contamination rate was closer to 7 percent, according to the association.<sup>1</sup>  \n  </p>  ",

The probe zipped by at upwards of 31,000 miles per hour, about the same speed it was going when it passed Pluto in 2015. But Pluto is 100 times the size of Ultima, which measures just 20 miles long. So New Horizons had days to capture photographs and spectrographic readings of the former planet, but for this smaller cosmic quarry, it only had a matter of minutes.

The machine, not smart enough to do the actual difficult job of converting these sophisticated image types to each other, found a way to cheat that humans are bad at detecting. This could be avoided with more stringent evaluation of the agent’s results, and no doubt the researchers went on to do that.\n  <br /><br />\n  As always, computers do exactly what they are asked, so you have to be very specific in what you ask them. In this case the computer’s solution was an interesting one that shed light on a possible weakness of this type of neural network — that the computer, if not explicitly prevented from doing so, will essentially find a way to transmit details to itself in the interest of solving a given problem quickly and easily.\n  This is really just a lesson in the oldest adage in computing: PEBKAC. “Problem exists between keyboard and computer.” Or as HAL put it: “It can only be attributable to human error.”\n  <br /><br />\n  The intention of the researchers was, as you might guess, to accelerate and improve the process of turning satellite imagery into Google’s famously accurate maps. To that end the team was working with what’s called a CycleGAN — a neural network that learns to transform images of type X and Y into one another, as efficiently yet accurately as possible, through a great deal of experimentation.\n  <br /><br />\n  In some early results, the agent was doing well — suspiciously well. What tipped the team off was that, when the agent reconstructed aerial photographs from its street maps, there were lots of details that didn’t seem to be on the latter at all. For instance, skylights on a roof that were eliminated in the process of creating the street map would magically reappear when they asked the agent to do the reverse process\n \n<sup>1</sup>\n  </p>\n  <p>Unfathomably focused A.I. means that an \"Off\" switch ought to be multi-dimensionally redundant -- planned out for unforeseen environments, option range and resources available as a codebase grows!</p>   \n  ",

Beaming the internet via satellites orbiting closer to the planet has been tried before. The idea was popular at the height of the tech boom of the late 1990s. Three companies—Teledesic, Iridium and Globalstar—poured tens of billions of dollars into the low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellite internet. It culminated in the collapse of Teledesic. Although the technology of the time worked, it was very costly and so the services on offer had to be hugely expensive, too. Iridium survived, but as a niche provider of satellite telephony, not a purveyor of cheap and fast internet access.\n  <br /><br />\n\n  OneWeb is among several firms that are trying LEO satellites again. SpaceX, a rocket company founded by Elon Musk, a tech entrepreneur, is guarded about its proposed system, Starlink, but on November 15th American regulators approved an application for 7,518 satellites at an altitude of 340km [200miles] (bringing the total for which the firm has approval to nearly 12,000).

There and in bouncing-droplet labs that soon sprang up at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and elsewhere, droplets were seen to tunnel through barriers and perform other acts previously thought to be uniquely quantum. In reproducing quantum phenomena without any of the mystery, the bouncing-droplet experiments rekindled in some physicists de Broglie’s old dream of a reality at the quantum scale that consists of pilot waves and particles instead of probability waves and conundrums.<br /><br />\n\nBut a series of bouncing-droplet findings since 2015 has crushed this dream. The results indicate that Couder’s most striking demonstration of quantum-like phenomena, back in 2006 — “the experiment that got me hooked on this problem,” the fluid dynamicist Paul Milewski said — was in error. Repeat runs of the experiment, called the “double-slit experiment,” have contradicted Couder’s initial results and revealed the double-slit experiment to be the breaking point of both the bouncing-droplet analogy and de Broglie’s pilot-wave vision of quantum mechanics.\n  <sup>1</sup></p>\n ",

With less fanfare, economists also earn their due prestige for working toward a sustainable prosperity.     </p>\n<p class=\"quote\"> This year’s [Nobel Prize] Laureates William Nordhaus and Paul Romer have significantly broadened the scope of economic analysis by constructing  models that explain how the market economy interacts with nature and knowledge. <br /><br />\n Romer demonstrates how knowledge can function as a driver of long-term economic \ngrowth. When annual economic growth of a few per cent accumulates over decades, it transforms people’s lives. \nPrevious macroeconomic research had emphasised technological innovation as the primary driver of economic \ngrowth, but had not modelled how economic decisions and market conditions determine the creation of new \ntechnologies. Paul Romer solved this problem by demonstrating how economic forces govern the willingness of \nfirms to produce new ideas and innovations. \n<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p>The economist in turn practices what he preaches by using only open-source software--to the aim of democratizing research itself:</p>\n<p class=\"quote\">Romer believes in making research transparent. He argues that openness and clarity about methodology is important for scientific research to gain trust. As Romer explained in an April 2018 blog post, in an effort to make his own work transparent, he tried to use Mathematica to share one of his studies in a way that anyone could explore every detail of his data and methods. It didn’t work. He says that Mathematica’s owner, Wolfram Research, made it too difficult to share his work in a way that didn’t require other people to use the proprietary software, too. Readers also could not see all of the code he used for his equations.\n<br /><br />\nInstead of using Mathematica, Romer discovered that he could use a Jupyter notebook for sharing his research. Jupyter notebooks are web applications that allow programmers and researchers to share documents that include code, charts, equations, and data. Jupyter notebooks allow for code written in dozens of programming languages. For his research, Romer used Python—the most popular language for data science and statistics.<sup>2</sup>\n</p>\n<p>The Bottom line is that yesterday's ink and paper is today's software and hardware--essential tools for success, the earlier the better. So, because historical suppression usually begins financially, equal access across social and economic lines.  So, the economic incentive to outfit every last citizen with free wifi and open-source technology. Already, the best in humanity--the Nobel winners--know the public incentive to harness the power of a widespread tech education. Because when the many and not the few create and advance technology, the economy blooms with real productivity.</p>\n  ",

Some of that speedup may come from using smaller transistors inside the A12, with features as small as 7 nanometers.<sup>1</sup>\n  </p>\n  <p>So, just as Apple tends to future-proof its technology, this year's release does not disappoint the constellation of iOS developers that can take advantage of the tech, with  better battery efficiency ...</p>\n  <p class=\"quote\">App developers can play with the power of Apple’s new neural engine through Core ML, a framework the company offers to help programmers deploy machine learning on Apple devices. The company says that this allows developers to run machine learning code nine times faster than on the iPhone X, while using a tenth of the energy.<sup>1</sup>\n  </p>\n  <p>Thanks to Apple's commitment to A.I., the iPhone Xs,   Xs Max, and   Xr offer all the joys of smart video/camera, processing, augmented reality, --<i>and with battery <strong>savings?</strong>   Ooh L&aacute; L&aacute;!</i>\n\n  ",

This, after the Ethereum (WEI) declines nearly ten-fold along with Bitcoin's 70% drop<sup>1</sup>, along with other major crypto-currencies. </p>\n  <p>The story is less dramatic and mysterious than it is simply the natural course of market novelties' <i>transition from Early Adapters to General Acceptance</i>: The underlying value transitions from increasing public awareness to mainstream acceptance, which requires new, ensuing <i>expectations that differ from the previous period</i>. The substance of perceived value dictates actual value. Buterin opines to Bloomberg News...\n    <p class=\"quote\"> \n     The blockchain space is getting to the point where there’s a ceiling in sight. If you talk to the average educated person at this point, they probably have heard of blockchain at least once. There isn’t an opportunity for yet another 1,000-times growth in anything in the space anymore ... Growth in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the blockchain community through its first six or seven years was dependent on marketing and trying to get wider adoption. <br /><br /> \nThat strategy is getting close to hitting a dead end.  The next step will be getting people who are already interested in cryptocurrencies to be involved in a more in-depth way. \"Go from just people being interested to real applications of real economic activity\" [Buterin] said.  <sup>2</sup></p> \n    <img src=\"https://tmm-nov.s3.amazonaws.com/img/diffusion.jpg\" class=\"zoom\" />\n    <p>So, the old expectations generated a very low bar to prove actual utility, whereas present-day collective knowledge demands clearer practical proof; inherently the bar is raised. And now, by technical sweat of the brow, crypto-based fintech now faces the realities of what will be needed for wide-spread use: technical solutions to scalability problems, security issues, and of course speed, availability and consistency of data transfer. Yet, now more importantly, ease-of-mainstream-use. </p>\n    <p>For example, Ethereum contract writers must learn a new language, Solidity; and Ethereum currency holders must grapple with browser-to-ledger interfaces like MetaMask, which are far from intuitive for even the most enthusiastic of early adopters!  </p>\n    <p> This concept is laid bare in sociological terms, citing Rogers and Shumacher's 1971 article from my Feb. 15 post: the general sociological Early Adopter theory--based on Everett M.

Blockchain and Directed Acyclic Graphs are less helpful, but find their utility in the unescapably fast ability to <i>share data where data is needed</i><br /><br /></p>\n     Manipulations of the quantum realm are not at all intuitive to concepts we learn from the classical world. Less intuitive are the constraints of the data analysis. For example, the quantum metaphor of flipping two coins simultaneously means knowing the \"state\" of one coin if you know the other coin's state. The one lands on heads, and because it shares an entangled state with the other, <i>you are guaranteed to know the outcome of the second coin</i>. </p>\n     <img src=\"https://tmm-nov.s3.amazonaws.com/img/quantumScience.jpg\"  class=\"zoom\" />\n     <p>Image credit: TechCrunch Disrupt!

Not exactly enough time to run a long program, especially if you consider just one small algorithm is a series of logical gates that depend sequentially on other logical gates..., let alone an actual program.

In our experiments teleportation is realized deterministically with high efficiency and achieves a high rate of transferred qubit states.

          "post": "<p class=\"firstparagraph\">Predictive analytics  has slowly progressed in sophistication over the past 45 years, and the current nexus with powerful machine-learning tools changes the health game: </p>\n    <p class=\"quote\"> A report by ABI Research June 2018 report highlighted a significant rise in patient monitoring devices, including AI for home-based preventative healthcare and predictive analytics, which could save hospitals around $52bn by 2021.<br /><br />\n\n    Accenture’s Digital Health Technology Vision 2018 report also claims that 85% of health executives in the US believe that every human will be directly impacted on a daily basis by an AI-based decision within the next three years.<br /><br />\n    \n    Utilising big data generated by clinical information and research can reveal clusters and patterns which can benefit all aspects of healthcare, leading patient care to become increasingly strategic.<sup>1</sup>  </p>\n    <p>It should be noted that the long road paved by statistical theory has revolutionized the above-mentioned fields as much as it now powers the practical use of analytics:</p>\n    <p class=\"quote\">Originating in the statistical (e.g., Holland\n      1986; Rosenbaum 2002; Rubin 2005, 2006) and\n      econometrics literature (see Heckman 2000,\n      2001, 2005; Heckman & Vytlacil 2007a,b;\n      Manski 1995, 2007), the counterfactual,\n      Rubin, or potential outcomes model of causality\n      has, over the past three decades, become\n      the standard conceptual tool to unify the notion\n      of causality, to understand the identification\n      problem at the heart of causal inference,\n      and to assess the utility of alternative estimation\n      techniques (Sobel 2005).<sup>2</sup></p>\n      <p>So, the take-away here is that A.I. and <i>Machine-Learning Research could have never progressed so quickly if not for the settled scientic paradigm over sound analysis that rules out spurious variables, while properly weighting the conditions that matter.</i> Furthermore, the mistakes in algorithm design were made in the 1970's, 1980's, and 1990's--misleading mistakes--have been swept aside, providing much-tested and refined strategies. The medical field's case exemplifies this evolution:</p>\n    <p class=\"quote\">Randomized controlled trials are considered the gold\n    standard for assessing the efficacy of medications, medical\n    procedures, or clinical strategies. Nevertheless, particularly\n    for research on the prevention of chronic disease, randomized\n    trials are often infeasible because of their size, time,\n    and budget requirements, as well as questionable generalizability\n    or ethical constraints.<br /><br />\n    On the other hand, nonexperimental studies of interventions\n    have frequently been criticized because of their potential\n    for selection bias. This concern reached a crescendo\n    with the disparity in estimated effects of hormone replacement\n    therapy from randomized trials and nonexperimental\n    studies. This imbroglio highlighted the need to develop\n    and apply improved methods to reduce bias in nonexperimental\n    studies in which selection bias or confounding is\n    likely to occur .<sup>3</sup></p>\n    <p>So, nowadays we don't ask for a second opinion when we can ask for a trillion opinions narrowed down to one heck of a second opinion!</p>",

A x86 CPU can do AI, but it does a task in 12 steps when only three are required; a GPU in some cases can also be overkill.\n    <br /><br />\n    Generally, scientific computation is done in a deterministic fashion. You want to know two plus three equals five and calculate it to all of its decimal places—x86 and GPU do that just fine. But the nature of AI is to say 2.5 + 3.5 is observed to be six almost all of the time without actually running the calculation. What matters with artificial intelligence today is the pattern found in the data, not the deterministic calculation. \n    <br /><br />\nThe result of this predictive problem solving is that AI calculations can be done with single precision calculations. So while CPUs and GPUs can both do it very well, they are in fact overkill for the task. A single-precision chip can do the work and do it in a much smaller, lower power footprint.</p>\n\n<p class=\"quote\">Intel \"can deliver on CPU functionality, which has dropped in performance, but still lags on GPUs and modems,\" noted Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the Enderle Group.\n\n\"Much of the performance these days is gated by the modem and the GPU, not the CPU, which just isn't as importance as it once was,\" he told TechNewsWorld.\n\nDevelopers may not benefit much from the new processors, Enderle said, because \"with IDF shut down, Intel's developer efforts are largely moot.\"\n</p> ",

They have a way of dramatizing their beliefs with an end-of-days scenario—and one does not want to criticize other people’s religions.”\n <sup>1</sup></p>\n <p class=\"quote\">\n Bostrom had little interest in conventional philosophy—not least because he expected that superintelligent minds, whether biologically enhanced or digital, would make it obsolete. “Suppose you had to build a new subway line, and it was this grand trans-generational enterprise that humanity was engaged in, and everybody had a little role,” he told me. “So you have a little shovel. But if you know that a giant bulldozer will arrive on the scene tomorrow, then does it really make sense to spend your time today digging the big hole with your shovel? Maybe there is something else you could do with your time. Maybe you could put up a signpost for the great shovel, so it will start digging in the right place.” He came to believe that a key role of the philosopher in modern society was to acquire the knowledge of a polymath, then use it to help guide humanity to its next phase of existence—a discipline that he called “the philosophy of technological prediction.” \n <sup>1</sup></p>\n <p>At the end of the day, we can ask \"are we there yet?\" over again, but a more pointed query asks not about time, but about place: \"It may be highly unpredictable where a traveller will be one hour after the start of her journey, yet predictable that after five hours she will be at her destination.”\n ",

The simplest way to train A.I. models is to feed them lots of well-labeled examples—thousands of cat images, or translated texts. Big Tech has access to so much consumer-oriented data that it’s all but impossible for anyone else to compete at building large-scale consumer products. But businesses, governments, and other institutions own huge amounts of private information. Even if a corporation uses Google for email, or Amazon for cloud computing, it doesn’t typically let those vendors access its internal databases about equipment malfunctions, or sales trends, or processing times. <br />\n  <br />That’s where Element sees an opening. If it can access several companies’ databases of, say, product images, it can then—with customers’ permission—use all of that information to build a better product-recommendation engine. Big Tech companies are also selling A.I. products and services to businesses—IBM is squarely focused on it—but no one has cornered the market.

The first, Geoffrey Hinton, a 70-year-old Brit who teaches at the University of Toronto, pioneered the subfield called deep learning that has become synonymous with A.I. The second, a 57-year-old Frenchman named Yann LeCun, worked in Hinton’s lab in the 1980s and now teaches at New York University. The third, 54-year-old Yoshua Bengio, was born in Paris, raised in Montreal, and now teaches at the University of Montreal. The three men are close friends and collaborators, so much so that people in the A.I. community call them the Canadian Mafia.<sup>1.</sup></p>\n\n  <p class=\"firstparagraph\">A curious path of punctuated advancement due to insufficient memory and cpu power, characterized late 20th century A.I. development: Deep Learning development   lulls interrupted by rapid growth with each successive technological period.\n   Toronto's Dr. Geoff Hinton's single-layered A.I. algorithm gained brief fame, yet A.I. research no longer advanced  for ten years. </p>\n   <p class=\"quote\">\n   Programs that performed well in the laboratory were useless in everyday situations; a simple act like picking up a ball turned out to require an overwhelming number of computations.\n\nThe research fell into the first of several “A.I. winters.” As Bostrom notes in his book, “Among academics and their funders, ‘A.I.’ became an unwanted epithet.”<sup>1</sup> \n</p>\n<p>\nThen came the GPU with Alex Khreshinski's famous image-recognition competition-winning penmanship detector, which notably is still in use by the banking system. This novel use of the GPU to accomplish parallel calculations rewrote the the A.I. field overnight. Also known as the \"Cambrian Explosion\", this event (and really just the algorithm) set off widespread advancements in the weeks and months follwoing, leading to new speciation ranging from the ANN, Neural Network, to a whole alphabet soup from Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) <i>to far-reaching mutations of Reinforcement Learning</i>.<sup>2</sup>\n  </p>\n \n  <p> Along with Hinton's close collaborator throughout the 1980's and 90's, Dr. Yoshua Bengio of the University of Montr&eacute;al, the researchers remain committed to humanity's service:</p>\n   \n  <p class=\"quote\">\n  Hinton moved from the U.S. to Canada in part due to disillusionment with Reagan-era politics and disapproval of military funding of artificial intelligence.[22] He believes political systems will use AI to \"terrorize people\". Hinton has petitioned against lethal autonomous weapons. Regarding existential risk from artificial intelligence, Hinton has stated that superintelligence seems more than 50 years away, but warns that \"there is not a good track record of less intelligent things controlling things of greater intelligence\". Asked in 2015 why he continues research despite his grave concerns, Hinton stated \"I could give you the usual arguments. But the truth is that the prospect of discovery is too sweet.\" Hinton has also stated that \"It is very hard to predict beyond five years\" what advances AI will bring.<sup>1</sup></p>\n  \n  <p>While Hinton and company aren't necessarily Mahatma Gandhi-like, their devotion to a science prioritized to humanity' service and long-term best interest--free from monetary or other influence is admirable.

Economists predict any of these scenarios will force the average worker to do practically the same thing throughout their careers: keep learning and learning and learning.\n<br /><br />\nSome colleges in the United States are already preparing for this age of perpetual education, including the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business. The Ann Arbor school launched a scholarship program that pays for graduates to take classes there forever, and the number of students is slowly growing.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p>\n<p>But what really is the time-scale on this big transformation? Most things operate like they always have, and honestly, maybe we can be a little more picky about what, how, and <strong>why  we \"optimize\" the things we do. But that kind of old-fashioned Ludditism is not the age we live in. Today, everything has to change to stay compatible!  A more telling detail from the New York Times:</p>\n<p class=\"quote\">And we’ve digitized only about 20 percent of the economy, meaning there’s tremendous technological climate change yet ahead. These climate changes are reshaping the ecosystem of work — wiping out huge numbers of middle-skilled jobs — and this is reshaping the ecosystem of learning, making lifelong learning the new baseline for advancement.<sup>2</sup></p>\n<p>20%?

The most recent exponential leaps in computing power--most notably for A.I. purposes, are thanks only to the Graphical Processing Unit. Progress followed a linear path in as 1998 world, a world enlightened by the pivotal A.I. publication, \"Convolutional Neural Netowrks for Handwritten Digital Recognition\" (Lecun, Bottou, <strong>Bengio</strong>, Haffner, 1998) to the present use in blockchain computing and deep learning algorithms, among many other purposes. The technical advantage offered by Nvidia explained by 2012's \"ImageNet Classification with NVIDIA GPUs (Krizhevsky, Hintou, et al.). Ten years ago, Daniele G. Spamintato and Anne C. Elstery offer a succinct explanation:\n</p>\n<p class=\"quote\">Optimization algorithms are becoming increasingly more important in many areas, such as finance and engineering. Typically, real problems involve several hundreds of variables, and are subject to as many constraints. Several methods have been developed trying to reduce the theoretical time complexity. Nevertheless, when problems exceed reasonable sizes they end up being very computationally intensive. Heterogeneous systems composed by coupling commodity CPUs and GPUs are becoming relatively cheap, highly performing systems.\n<br />\n<br /> Recent developments of GPGPU technologies give even more powerful control over them. In this paper, we show how we use a revised simplex algorithm for solving linear programming problems originally described by Dantzig for both our CPU and GPU implementations. Previously, this approach has showed not to scale beyond around 200 variables. However, by taking advantage of modern libraries such as ATLAS for matrix-matrix multiplication, and the NVIDIA CUDA programming library on recent GPUs, we show that we can scale to problem sizes up to at least 2000 variables in our experiments for both architectures. On the GPU, we also achieve an appreciable precision on large problems with thousands of variables and constraints while achieving between 2X and 2.5X speed-ups over the serial ATLAS-based CPU version. With further tuning of both the algorithm and its implementations, even better results should be achievable for both the CPU and GPU versions.<sup>2</sup></p>\n<p>So, given the exponential development advantages of GPU use, it's clear the horizon for more and more developers implicates high computing needs.  So, what exactly is novel yet increasingly a household developer tool? </p>\n<p class=\"quote\">\nCUDA® is a parallel computing platform and programming model developed by NVIDIA for general computing on graphical processing units (GPUs). With CUDA, developers are able to dramatically speed up computing applications by harnessing the power of GPUs.<br /><br />\n\nIn GPU-accelerated applications, the sequential part of the workload runs on the CPU – which is optimized for single-threaded performance – while the compute intensive portion of the application runs on thousands of GPU cores in parallel. When using CUDA, developers program in popular languages such as C, C++, Fortran, Python and MATLAB and express parallelism through extensions in the form of a few basic keywords.\n<br /><br />\nThe CUDA Toolkit from NVIDIA provides everything you need to develop GPU-accelerated applications. The CUDA Toolkit includes GPU-accelerated libraries, a compiler, development tools and the CUDA runtime.\n<sup>3</sup></p>\n<p>And, this tech is arriving at both the mainstream PC-optimization level as much as typical university research, the potential of both laid out in a June 2018 Wired Magazine article:</p>\n<p class=\"quote\">PCs that work on smartphone parts.

But the true advances have been a long time in development, and credit belongs to Statistics and Data Science, and specifically quantitative analysis' ever cleverer classification trees that deliver the goods with greater accuracy, coupled with less intensive computing costs. And this origin is interesting in itself: </p>\n <p class=\"quote\">\nFifty years have passed since the publication of the first regression tree algorithm. New techniques have added capabilities that far surpass those of the early methods. Modern classification trees can partition the data with linear splits on subsets of variables and fit nearest neighbor, kernel density, and other models in the partitions ... <br />\n<br />Classification And Regression Trees (CART) (Breiman et al., 1984) was instrumental in regenerating interest in the subject. It follows the same greedy search approach as  Automatic Interaction Detection (AID) and THeta Automatic Interaction Detection (THAID), but adds several novel improvements. Instead of using stopping rules, it grows a large tree and then prunes the tree to a size that has the lowest cross-validation estimate of error. The pruning procedure itself is ingenious, being based on the idea of weakest-link cutting, with the links indexed by the values of a cost-complexity parameter. This solves the under-fitting and over-fitting problems of  AID and THeta Automatic Interaction Detection (THAID), although with increased computation cost.<sup>1</sup>\n</p>\n<p>Today, Machine Learning curricula usually begin with the same sample datasets on Iris characteristics (pictured below)</p>\n<img style=\"min-width:300px;\"  src=\"https://tmm-nov.s3.amazonaws.com/img/learningData.PNG\"><br /><br />\n<p>So how does it really work, in oversimplified terms? Contrary to most algorithms' step-by-step manual decision-making through for- and while-loops, if-else, and so on, the scalability of design clearly falls off. Enter Deep Learning, which is nothing more mystical than simple classification--i.e. decision--trees. Beginning with a million choices, a decision passes through multiple layers that may or may not be activated, and with each activated layer, a decision is narrowed down, until finally a decision is reached between recognizing a dog and a cat!\n</p><img style=\"min-width:300px;\" src=\"https://tmm-nov.s3.amazonaws.com/img/classifTree.PNG\">\n</p><img style=\"min-width:300px;\" src=\"https://tmm-nov.s3.amazonaws.com/img/classifTree2.PNG\"><br /><br />\n<p>And yet, for all of this science, up until 2011, the error rate for simple shape recognition, like say a dog from a cat still averaged a 26% error rate! A mere 7 years later? Today, that error rate averages less than 3% error, most recently due to computing, power, and memory advances.   Those come in handy for delivering a warehouse worth of computing onto your smartphone! That's a boon for delivering sensors, i.e. training data, into the environment. My last post mentioned Google's upcoming, yet unnamed Android OS...but we do know it's a candy that starts with \"P\"...my guess is Peppermint Patties? Or maybe Pez has more of a ring to it.</p>  \n<p  >\nWhatever the new OS is called, it comes with a developing potential to exponentially advance <i>Tree Science</i>:  ML Kit behaves like an API layer connecting the ML software to the app developers' models, making dev easy to run and deploy with an \"experimental model compression flow that aims to reduce model size (up to orders of magnitudes) while maintaining similar accuracy.\"<sup>3</sup> Talk about maturing exponentially quickly! Now, this origin story can't compete with Wolverine's nor Han Solo's, but this gem carries a mythical and futuristic potential to satisfy screen-goers from all devices, frame-sizes, and platforms!</p>\n",

ML Kit allows developers to use the camera for face detection, landmark recognition, text recognition, and a host of other recognition features.<sup>2</sup></p>\n<p>\nSo, in conceptual terms, this means developing app-data models that are <i>optimized for mobile inference</i>. This means that the long process of acquiring enough training data to optimize an app's design or behavior (generally or specifically user personalization), can now be shortened with better quantity and quality of training data &aacute; la machine learning. So in concrete terms, the past 15 years' of Google ML research is now distilled into (again, still beta) an SDK (software developers' kit) that facilitates dev integration without needing to hand-make a model to access the run-time environment. \n</p>\n<p>In other words, past server-side inferences now jump to the mobile device, and tap into   on-device machine learning library framework and toolkit--i.e. TensorFlowLite. This jump-starts customized application of machine learning already in production--that is, Android devices' <i>Neural Networks API</i> and <i>iOS' Metal</i>.  \n</p>\n<p>What makes this new programming horizon most interesting is that an equally new feature, called \"Actions\" and \"Slices\",  allows for certain app features to be accessed by the phone itself outside of the app. A May 8th Verge article explains:\n\n</p>\n<p class=\"quote\">\nGoogle is introducing developers to a couple of terms: “Actions” and “Slices.” They are essentially deep links into apps that are able to surface in other parts of the operating system. Actions are analogous to Actions on Google Assistant; Slices are a subset that can show the app’s own UI when you type out a global search on the phone.\n<br /><br />\nThe idea behind both of these concepts is to break out the different pieces of the apps you use into the larger operating system. Samat calls it the “decomposition of apps,” though without the connotations of death. “Yeah, you want to go the app,” he says, “but actually what you want to do is go to your house or reorder from Instacart.”\n<br /><br />\nDevelopers will need to build some frameworks into their apps to make Actions and Slices available to the system. When they do, the AI in Android P will try to understand what those apps can actually do and suggest those actions to you. “When you modularize the app, it’s not just an API call,” Samat says. “You have these components that can be understood by the system, predicted by the system, and then rendered by the system.”<sup>3</sup>\n</p>\n<p>So what does this mean?

Simple enough, and that's why massive, intractable application programs like AutoCAD can now be easily deployed on any platform, fast and high-function on our mobile phones.

It's actually safer than traditional plug-ins for browsers. Here's a quick recap from yesterday's post on WebAssembly:</p>\n<p class=\"quote\">WebAssembly is one of the biggest advances to the Web Platform over the past decade.\n\nThis new standard will enable amazing video games and high-performance web apps for things like computer-aided design, video and image editing, and scientific visualization. Over time, many existing productivity apps (e.g. email, social networks, word processing) and JavaScript frameworks will likely use WebAssembly to significantly reduce load times while simultaneously improving performance while running. Unlike other approaches that have required plug-ins to achieve near-native performance in the browser, WebAssembly runs entirely within the Web Platform. This means that developers can integrate WebAssembly libraries for CPU-intensive calculations (e.g. compression, face detection, physics) into existing web apps that use JavaScript for less intensive work.<sup>1</sup>\n</p><p>\nBrowsers, <i>despite HTTPS encryption, are growing in security weaknesses</i> with more territory, responsibilities, and new API relationships. However, along with WebAssembly's solutions for CPU-intensive browser operations (like AutoCAD example in the previous post), WebAssembly also offers unique security solutions:  \n</p>\n<p class=\"quote\">WebAssembly describes a memory-safe, sandboxed execution environment that may even be implemented inside existing JavaScript virtual machines. When embedded in the web, WebAssembly will enforce the same-origin and permissions security policies of the browser.<sup>2.</sup></p>\n<p>\n This architecture   signifies eventual compatibility with the existing Block Chain apps like MetaMask that use a browser plug-in to set up an API between, for example, the Ethereum blockchain and Web access. So, with WebAssembly's great potential with JavaScript, is it a safer, more secure on-line world? No, but <i>there are safer corners </i> ... and certainly a safer niche for drawing space!</p>\n\n",

          "post": "<p class=\"firstparagraph\">AutoCAD, the first name in 3-D engineering, has stepped into a new world in the past month. Recent, unprecedented mobile app advances allow more CPU-intensive laptop applications to hop to the phone with equal interactivity and near-equal functionality. Thanks to third-party languages, JavaScript, the browser's language, is broadening in powers: And this is nothing short of exhilarating with just enough of a touch of danger.\n</p><p>AutoCAD's recent advances in their mobile platform exemplifies this trend.<sup>1</sup> AutoCAD, the ancient, foundational, ultra-powerful, ever-modernizing programming codebase--celebrates 35 years old, and predates the web! AutoCAD by AutoDesk has historically had difficulty implementing its codebase into mobile platforms. So, their app presence suffered because it had been highly watered down, and suddenly competing with thousands of other 3-D engineering apps...Until now. </p><p>\n\n<p class=\"quote\">Yesterday [March 2, 2018] was a big day for the AutoCAD product. A multi-year engineering project – started in the AutoCAD team way back when I was part of it – culminated in its first deliverables getting into the hands (or, in this case, browsers) of customers.  The AutoCAD team has been working on a project codenamed “Fabric” for the last several years. It's has been a huge amount of work – something I’ll hopefully get into in a future blog post – but it’s finally bearing tangible fruit.  In broad strokes the work was to take the core of AutoCAD and make it cross-platform. </p><p class=\"quote\">You might consider the Big Split – work that was done ostensibly to build AutoCAD for Mac but resulted in a Core Engine that became the mechanism through which developers could run custom code in the cloud via AutoCAD I/O (now part of Forge’s Design Automation API) – to be the first phase of this effort. At the very least Fabric stood on the shoulders of the Big Split.<sup>2.</sup></p><p>\n\nIn short, AutoDesk's latest browser-based AutoCAD Web App and Mobile App have suddenly advanced a quantum step. For example, the mobile app provides nearly all of the full features (not including 3-D rendering), like swapping .DWG files from cloud services using a full mobile interface.  </p>\n<p>\nNot just for AutoCAD, but all apps improve, because <i>third-party languages like WebAssembly can \"broker\" the API conversation between browser and the operating system's machine code for certain tasks</i>.<sup>3</sup> Exceptionally interesting, now WebAssembly performs real-time C++ transpiling allowing any browser to communicate in near-to direct machine-code for certain tasks. \nWebAssembly (Wasm) is a \"binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine ... designed as a portable target for compilation of high-level languages like C/C++/Rust, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications.\"<sup>3</sup> In other words, <i>WebAssembly is the middle-person translating between JavaScript's V8 Engine and a device's Operating System</i>. Here's  a clearer explanation using the AutoCAD example:</p>\n<p class=\"quote\">[AutoCAD's] Fabric has done away with #ifdefs, forcing any platform-specific code into a PAL (Platform Abstraction Layer) per targeted platform. And Fabric is able to target more than just Windows and OS X. Some of the main targets were the established mobile platforms (more on that down the line), but one major effort was to target the web platform with the AutoCAD codebase.\nYes, you read that right… yesterday’s update to AutoCAD Web now runs the same core code as standard AutoCAD, but in a browser. A major part of AutoCAD’s C++ codebase gets run through Emscripten (at least that’s my understanding – I’ll correct any details I get wrong) to be transpiled into WebAssembly. \n<p>\n<p>So, it looks like our <i>wild, untamed language, JavaScript, has matured to the big-leagues </i> by teaming up with WebAssembly ... After all, JavaScript, among all the languages, was born without a mind for math... literally. It's core math library conducts all operations in 64-bit floating point, in the absence of integers! So, this entails occasional anomalies: For example, .1 + .2 does not equal .3! (Try it with the JavaScript calculator below ... ) And so, great things await this partnership between WebAssembly and JavaScript, but every marriage is different... one partner may always need help cooking, and another may always need help with the math, but that's what Marriage is for!</p>\n\n\n \n",

Why risk replacing it with a less well-tested technology whose vulnerabilities haven’t all been identified? Also, while it can retain as much transactional data as needed, hashgraph typically doesn’t contain as much transactional history as the Bitcoin blockchain does. For many applications, hashgraph would only keep track of users’ latest positive wallet balances.\n\n  Second, the DAG system doesn’t involve the computation-heavy “proof of work” effort to verify transactions that some blockchains, such as Bitcoin blockchain, require. Having several miners ratify and vote to accept a transaction lends blockchain what some say is a greater degree of security that the ledger contains a single version of the truth than under DAG-based systems. \n  <br />\n  <br />\n  IOTA, the best-known DAG, is already the No. 10 largest cryptocurrency, with $6.6 billion in market capitalization, according to CoinMarketCap. \n  \n  “Even first-year computer science students here at MIT laugh at the code when they see it,” Tadge Dryja, a research scientist at MIT who is working to scale the Bitcoin network, said in an email. \n  \n  The hack MIT came up with “can’t happen in practice,” Serguei Popov, one of the founders of IOTA, said in a phone interview.\n  \n  \nHashgraph uses DAG differently: It uses it to record different aspects of transactions than IOTA, and has different security characteristics, according to hashgraph developers.\n<sup>1</sup>\n   \n\n\n\n  ",

The formal release is on May 9th, but this May 1st press release caught my attention as we see a glimpse of this technology on a public* ledger: \n</p>\n<p class=\"quote\"> CULedger and Hedera today announced a partnership whereby CULedger will use Hedera's hashgraph platform and public ledger to build a system for cross-border payments. CULedger has already been using the private ledger version of hashgraph, offered by Swirlds, for general purpose, permissioned ledger use.<sup>1</sup> </p>\n<p>The big news is Hedera's \"public\" blockchain ledger service that moves closer to popular usage with it's unique <i>directed acyclic graphs</i>, whose speed increases with scale.  Until recently, Blockchain tech has been hamstrung in the domain of micro-transactions, so now that the barrier has been crossed, how many sectors of life will be enhanced? All. But not yet. Once 5G technology (100 times faster, 100 times the capacity of 4G) is rolled out, then we hit the big leagues.</p> \n<p class=\"quote\">A group of U.S. credit unions looking to pool resources considered the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains to track their business, but wound up selecting something else entirely: hashgraph.</p>\n<p class=\"quote\">Currently, cross-border payments are painful for all parties involved,\" said Rick Cranston, COO of CULedger. \"They take time, they're expensive, and there is limited visibility into the transaction. Hashgraph is fast and it provides visibility between the two parties at a significantly lower cost. It also eliminates concerns regarding fraud and default, since transactions are recorded immutably on the public ledger, and manual processes, since transactions are automated via smart contracts.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p> ...to be continued...</p> \n\n",

The premise of the show, and the current state of A.I., is instinctual learning and behavior of A.I.--i.e. imitating animal-behavior, but not human. </p>\n  <p>I had the good luck of spending the Fall of 2016 in the Silicon Valley of A.I. technology, which is Montr&eacute;al, Qu&eacute;bec (For example, UdeM was awarded $100 million in research money from Facebook). Though I was there for a Sociology PhD, I still got to get involved like any technology groupie would...  The rock-star out there is Universit&eacute de Montr&eacute;al's Dr. Yoshua Bengio,<sup>3</sup> who explains the consciousness elements of A.I, and how those compare with our own representations:\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"quote\">\n  With supervised learning, humans provide the high-level concepts that the computer learns, which can be tedious and limits the ability of computers to discover things by themselves. Unsupervised learning, or what we call reinforcement learning, is when the learner is not merely passively observing the world, or how humans do things, but interacts with the environment and gets feedback. Humans are good at this. Combining unsupervised deep learning and reinforcement learning is one of the things that I am working on.<sup>2</sup>\n  </p> \n  <p>So, here we see how Yoshua Bengio  explains that <i>building of meaning, symbolic representation as the key impediment</i>. To get around this, representations are <i>factorialized</i>, which is a clean way of saying multiple levels/dimensions of classification trees:</p>\n  <p class=\"quote\">For more than a decade, my research has focused on the notion of learning better representations, which is the heart of deep learning, in particular, representations that have a property called disentangled. Disentangled separates the different concepts and different explanations - we call them factors - that explain the data, that explain what the agent sees around it, and that explain how the agent patrols the world. Disentangled captures some of the causality that explains what we are seeing and what the computer is seeing.<sup>2</sup>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n  I think it's exciting subject matter, and perhaps many would be less apprehensive if they thought of A.I. as achieving the behavior and  <i>predictable mind of pets</i>.  Pets and service pets can be a reassuring thought--even for A.I. pessimists like Elon Musk. Pets...

Two months ago, my <a href=\"#18-02-23\">Feb. 23rd blogpost</a> and again on <a href=\"#18-03-08\">March 8th</a> I mentioned 1.4 million new tech jobs, 20% growth year-over-year. And so, yours truly has decided to enter into this market after a post-graduate period of contracting and free-lance work. Let's face it, there's no substitute for the stability and the fixed schedule, plus the coffee-machine conversations are never short of endearing! </p>\n\n\n  <p>So far on day 2 (Friday, the 21st was my ceremonial first day of \"putting myself out there\"). I've thought to start slow, while I gauge the territory, but Indeed and Linkdin are always safe bets to begin with. All in all, my general take is that this new job front, with hundreds of thousands of jobs month-over-month is for everyone. Most positions offer 9-12 weeeks training -- who ever said changing careers had to be shouldered on our own? HR is there! </p>\n  <p>As I am a night-blogger, therefore my new position--where and whichever it will be, won't interfere with my blogging--after all, I have truly enjoyed watching my readership grow, month-by-month ... so, thank you, dear tech readers. As such, perhaps along the way I can lend a view from the job-front, and any new trends I observe.</p>\n  <p>Examples aren't hard to find. I've noticed that since the last time I've checked out the job market, the pre-assessment tests are a bit more cognitive than previous years, which is good for strong test-takers--especially those that love to calculate the \"arrival times of two separate trains leaving the same station at two different rates of speed ....\". 50 questions in 15 minutes makes for a nice adrenaline rush--on par with a short run!  </p>",

Variables, Functions, Modules.  With so many languages used for different purposes by different organizations, syntax is more than 4-space indents, variable name-spaces, and other formalities. Today, the variety of coding languages and scripts can appear more complicated than is/+*- the case: After all, all computer <i>languages boil down to the same primary tasks: for &amp; while loops, if-then statements, variable declarations, scope considerations, etc ...</i>     \n  </p>\n  <p>So what am I getting at? Coding innovation is an art form that surpasses science and knowledge. For example,   coding practices improve with clarity, simplicity, modularity, and so on... but is there an authoritative <i>school of thought</i> on this art? Well, in the Python world, all eyes turn to the Zen of Python, and some say other languages should emulate its philosophy, so let's hear it:</p>\n  <p class=\"quote\">\n  <strong>The Zen of Python</strong><br /><br />\n  \n  Beautiful is better than ugly.<br /><br />\n  \n  Explicit is better than implicit.<br /> <br />\n  \n  Simple is better than complex.<br /> <br />\n  \n  Complex is better than complicated.<br /> <br />\n  \n  Flat is better than nested.<br /> <br />\n  \n  Sparse is better than dense.<br /> <br />\n  \n  Readability counts.<br /> <br />\n  \n  Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.<br /><br />\n  \n  Although practicality beats purity.<br /><br />\n  \n  Errors should never pass silently.<br /><br />\n  \n  Unless explicitly silenced.<br /><br />\n  \n  In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.<br /><br />\n  \n  There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.<br /><br />\n  \n  Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.<br /><br />\n  \n  Now is better than never.<br />\n  <br />\n  Although never is often better than *right* now.<br /><br />\n  \n  If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.<br /><br />\n  \n  If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.<br /><br />\n  \n  Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those! <sup>2</sup><br />\n  \n  <br />\n  --Pythoneer Tim Peters\n  </p>\n  <p>I get it, good coding is more than intuitive art, it's walking the high road without regard for shortcuts. And I can see that <i>in uncharted waters, intuition has to be constrained by sound reason.</i> And who hasn't been burned by artful exploration, fancy coding, and far-fetched architectures? So where does the balance lie? Again we must turn to Steve Jobs on the \"intersection of the humanities and science,\": </p>\n  <p class=\"quote\">There are a lot of people innovating, and that's not the main distinction of my career. The reason Apple resonates with people is that there's a deep current of humanity in our innovation. I think great artists and great engineers are simi.ar in that they both have a desire to express themselves. In fact some of the best people working on the original Mac were poets and musicans on the side. In the seventies computers became a way for people to express their creativity. Great artists like Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo were also great art science. Michelangelo knew a lot about how to quarry stone, not just how to be a sculptor.\" <sup>1</sup><br />--Steve Jobs\n  <p class=\"continue\">I could not imagine a computing world were it not for the personalization that Apple introduced to the world, to us all. After all, I recall I was first transfixed in 1984, there I was a seven-year-old staring into the bright green letters   of my   Apple IIe ... </p>\n  <p>So, in this era of the algorithmic wild-west and impending regulations on data privacy, inter-app permissions, coupled with data breaches every week, how might regulations avoid stifling innovation? Steve Jobs didn't have rules as much as Mark Zuckerberg didn't have any rules. So, it's a relief that Zuckerberg, with intimate knowledge of innovation, can set his teams to work with Congress going forward, especially as Facebook conforms to the E.U.'s <i>General Data Privacy Regulations (GDPR) implementation this May.</i> I for one hope that freedom for creative innovation will stay alive, even in the face of   growing bureaucracy in the web.   \n  <p class=\"cite\">1. <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=cf_2PBPP-rEC&printsec=frontcover\" target=\"blank\">Isaacson, Walter.

Yet,     new advances and types, i.e. \"groupings\" of blockchain technology are not necessarily \"replacing\" their predecessors, but rather filling different blockchain needs; Needs that include speed of transactions, truly public distributed ledgers, safety from forking and DDOS attacks.  Since 2008,   groups of competing platforms follow a timeline, but should not be thought of as a cyclical evolution but rather growing tree branches that form \"groups\".  Bitcoin, Litecoin are first generation, while Ethereum and Ripple are 2nd generation with crypto-contract capability, and finally Iota and Swirlds' Hedera Hashgraph represent   3rd generation <i>directed-acyclic-graphs (DAG), whose transaction speed actually  increases</i> with number of nodes.\n  </p>\n  <p>Each of these groupings shouldn't be seen as making the previous design obselete: They   serve different purposes. Bitcoin can never serve micro-transactions and the micro-economy because it can only handle 6 transactions per second (TPS), while Ethereum can handle 12 or so. However, micro-transaction industries require TPS in the hundreds of thousands! Only the 3rd gen  crypto-currency architecture   achieves TPS <i>ad infinitum</i> because it's scalability increases with size. The catch? DAG's are necessarily private entities, rather than the original two generations that are by nature public, yet can be privatized. 3rd generation DAGs are the opposite: They are by default private, and cannot truly be distributed without management. Further, <i>Swirlds Hashgraph has patented their source code, which contradicts many principles of blockchain technology</i>, beginning with core tenets  of the original crypto-currency white paper, published in October 2008. For history\n  's sake, here's a quick view of the Bitcoin paper's abstract:</p>\n  <p class=\"quote\"><strong>Abstract.</strong> A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled byi nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.<sup>1</sup></p>\n  \n  <p>Irrespective of crypto-currency or crypto-contract, there seems to be a different kind of jump from 2nd generation to 3rd generation blockchain, rather than a progression. Research needed to fork into a different direction is because of the need for instantaneous, ordered transactions, which can never be provided by a blockchain design which \"syncs\" every 5 to 10 minutes. </p>\n  <p> So, what is this 3rd generation design? Instead of a singular block encapsulated in linked cryptographic, historical ledger blocks, hashgraph uses a \"tangle\" of one-way (directed-acyclic) network connections. This means that speed increases with the number of nodes, overcoming the Bitcoin micro-transaction problem. <i>In sum, near-instantaneous updates for financial, betting, gaming and social-media data needs are solved by the  third-generation DAG</i>, while longer-term and truly distributed blockchain needs will always be the terrain of first and second generation blockchain technology. So, given that Swirlds' Hedera Hashgraph will be unveiling their platform next month,   blockchain critics and enthusiasts can and should read between the lines, er, I mean-- read  between the nodes ...</p><br />\n  <p class=\"cite\">0.

And, for all the pitfalls of Iota and the ever-evolving Ethereum (and ever-present threat of forking), Bitcoin stands true among the crypto-currency platforms. Keeping it Simple,   the very limited, non-crypto-contract may just be Bitcoin's virtue.

Maybe, Maybe not, but where does the future lie for all that hardware? Where does the browser fit into this? First, what's going on under the hood: Note this article is older, but accurate in explanation--except for references to Bitcoin's value! </p>  \n  \n  <p class=\"quote\">New bitcoins are created roughly every 10 minutes in batches of 25 coins, with each coin worth around $730 at current rates. [A typical home-] computer ... is racing thousands of others to unlock and claim the next batch.</p>\n  <p class=\"quote\">\n  Let’s start with what it’s not doing.  \n  Your computer is not blasting through the cavernous depths of the internet in search of digital ore that can be fashioned into bitcoin bullion. There is no ore, and bitcoin mining doesn’t involve extracting or smelting anything. It’s called mining only because the people who do it are the ones who get new bitcoins, and because bitcoin is a finite resource liberated in small amounts over time, like gold, or anything else that is mined. (The size of each batch of coins drops by half roughly every four years, and around 2140, it will be cut to zero, capping the total number of bitcoins in circulation at 21 million.) But the analogy ends there.\n  </p><p class=\"quote\">\n  What bitcoin miners actually do could be better described as competitive bookkeeping. Miners build and maintain a gigantic public ledger containing a record of every bitcoin transaction in history. Every time somebody wants to send bitcoins to somebody else, the transfer has to be validated by miners: They check the ledger to make sure the sender isn’t transferring money she doesn’t have. If the transfer checks out, miners add it to the ledger. Finally, to protect that ledger from getting hacked, miners seal it behind layers and layers of computational work—too much for a would-be fraudster to possibly complete.<sup>1</sup>\n  </p>\n  \n  <p>So all of this hard work <i>can be distributed</i> across browsers, which improves its energy-expensive plight. I wouldn't recommend running the demo in the article link below as it may overheat your device--it had my fan running double-time. But the internals are using JavaScript code for the math. Here's a look under the hood, and it's nice to see the role of <i>JavaScript graphics library, called D3JS, (Data Driven Documents)</i> playing a central role. So, below you see the browser accepting the SHA256 Hash along with the Bitcoin Owner's Address, and the JavaScript in the browser passes off calculations to the C++ running the JavaScript V8 engine on your computer. </p>\n  <img src=\"https://tmm-nov.s3.amazonaws.com/img/miningBlockchainD3.PNG\" class=\"zoom\" width=\"450px\" />\n  <p>And so, what does it mean to mine Bitcoins across browsers in a distributed fashion? It is similar to the same concept as Ethereum's direction (or at least idealized by its architect, Vitalik Buterin), in running the Ethereum Virtual Machine blockchain across all the browsers that download its GETH software. Nonetheless, here's a succinct explanation of the browser's role,again from Quartz: </p>\n  <p class=\"quote\">Mining’s ultimate purpose is to prevent people from double-spending bitcoins. But it also solves another problem. It distributes new bitcoins in a relatively fair way—only those people who dedicate some effort to making bitcoin work get to enjoy the coins as they are created.\n  But because mining is a competitive enterprise, miners have come up with ways to gain an edge. One obvious way is by pooling resources.<br /><br />\n  \n  \n  Your machine, right now, is actually working as part of a bitcoin mining collective that shares out the computational load. Your computer is not trying to solve the block, at least not immediately. It is chipping away at a cryptographic problem, using the input at the top of the screen and combining it with a nonce [run-time, generated random number calculated only once, then discarded], then taking the hash to try to find a solution. Solving that problem is a lot easier than solving the block itself, but doing so gets the pool closer to finding a winning nonce for the block. And the pool pays its members in bitcoins for every one of these easier problems they solve.</p>\n  <p>In practice, distributed mining pays off quite well   for the owners of that address. My blogposts on <a href=\"# <a href=\"#18-02-28\">February 26th  </a> and <a href=\"#18-02-28\">Feb. 28th about blockchain sustainability</a> paint a less rosy picture of tying the currency value to the cost of energy, but multiple solutions and fixes exist to distribute the energy load to laptops on clean renewables, the mining cooperative way ... after all, who ever said money had to be so expensive? </a> \n  <p class=\"cite\">1.<a href=\"https://qz.com/154877/by-reading-this-page-you-are-mining-bitcoins/\" target=\"_blank\">https://qz.com/154877/by-reading-this-page-you-are-mining-bitcoins/\n  </a> (The article link is harmless, but wouldn't recommend running it if low on batteries--it doubled the fan speed)</p>  ",

Important dialogue surrounded primarily   two data privacy topics: First, financial transparency surrounding ads and political ads based on the <i>Honest Ads Act</i>, for which Zuckerberg pledged support<sup>1</sup>. \n  </p>\n  <p>Second, and   more far-reaching, discussion of the <i>Browser Act</i> also was raised by several House members. While responding to the Act's sponsor, Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, Zuckerberg expressed interest in working together. This bill is not well known, but aims to set prudent, consistent guidelines of privacy in the hands of the consumer. </p>\n  <p class=\"quote\"> [Blackburn's] new bill targets the full spectrum of the internet, including web giants like Amazon and Google. In Blackburn’s words, it moves the government “to a posture where we have one regulator, one set of rules [and] everybody knows who’s in charge,” she told Recode.<sup>3</sup></p>\n  <p>So, however the power struggle goes, a <i>shared technology lexicon</i> clarifies that shades of meaning make enormous difference, depending on \"what\" an entity is--whether a technology is a Platform as a Service  versus media outlet or strictly merchant-based. Hopefully, <i>Tech will lead the way</i> without ceding authority in the process: </p>\n  <p class=\"quote\">\n    But the Tennessee lawmaker’s effort hasn’t won any allies among privacy-conscious consumer groups, like the American Civil Liberties Union, which doubt Blackburn’s methods. And her bill has already prompted a whole new round of fierce lobbying by tech and telecom giants, which don’t see the need for any new regulation at all.\n    </p> \n  <p class=\"quote\">\n  “I think that, in concept, the idea that there should be stronger privacy standards for edge providers and internet service providers is right,” said Neema Singh Guliani, the legislative counsel at the ACLU.</p>\n  <p class=\"quote\">\n  But Blackburn, she added, should have gone about it differently. “The way to do it was not ... [through] gutting the FCC’s rules; the way to do it was actively working on a replacement.”<sup>3</sup>\n  </p>\n  <p>The bill is similar to the European data privacy model, <i>E.U. General Data Protection Regulation(GDPR)</i>, which serves as point of reference.<sup>2</sup> On May 14,   Europeans will   be implementing a pan-internet--edge and ISP--data protections, which include e-mail, Facebook and other apps, equally as for Comcast and Verizon, and industry-wide privacy defaults; Further, opt-in for privacy is more meaningful separate, and  not relegated to the main Terms and Conditions.<sup>3</sup></p>\n  <p>Policy regulation in other industries--exemplified by medical <i>HIPAA</i>, financial <i>Fair Credit   Reporting Act</i>--reveals the noticeable absence of similar policy in Tech. Tech's regulation is however necessarily far more complex, involving at minimum trade-offs between app-to-app data portability and new boundaries for different sources and forms of data.

Although, in this case, <i>there were two, at times three, tennis balls at play!</i> What I mean is that \"Data\" and \"Personal Data\" vaccilated in meaning:  At times, Senators' questions referred to, 1.) personally identifiable data with intimate personal details, full name, location data (sensitive-data); 2.) Other times questions referred to <i>derivative data, i.e. data wrangled, refined, merged with different datasets</i> (composite-data); and,  3.) sometimes the questions meant the harmless, identity-encrypted \"ad-data\"(anonymized-data); but, usually, Zuckerberg responded to a question about one of these three meanings of \"personal data\", by responding with a non-abstract fourth: 4.) \"Senator, the data, the 'likes' and pictures you share with Facebook, they are your property,\" Zuckerberg would answer. Well, thank goodness! </p>\n  <p> My blogpost talks about the shades of meaning: We all know the light-hearted awkwardness when a conversation splits into two separate threads because each party unknowingly follows differing meanings from the same word, or idea.  Austin Powers would have more fun with it, but the Sociologists typically call it  a <i>Semantic Predicament</i>.<sup>1</sup></p> \n  <p>In fairness, Mark Zuckerberg volunteered as he himself was not subpoenaed, and therefore this preliminary, public discourse was critical for creating shared meaning and language about a complex topic. By volunteering to engage conversation with Senators, Zuckerberg interrupts the <i>game of telephone</i>; and, Senators engage with their constituents, and lo, America saves two years' of misunderstandings for clear data-protection action now. Bravo, Mark! Zuckerberg is perhaps one of the braver CEOs in American history--Now, he has earned his place right next to Andrew Carnegie--and very similar lives, too. And now, with defined boundaries, <i>Tech has a better roadmap</i> for ethical policy and sensible regulation.

These three fields approach research differently. Psychometricians are less causally oriented, as their tool, \"factor analysis\"--<i>analyse factorielle</i>--reduces complex data to dimple, categorical forms in order to reconcile <i>quantitative data</i> with intuitive categories.<sup>1.</sup> And this research is great for expanding knowledge about society. But to what end? Who's to say, after all society is both the subject <i>and</i> object of this research. Social scientists are used to these mental gymnastics, yet are bound by a certain ethos of research: <strong>Anonymization, i.e. encrypting or removing personally identifiable information from datasets</strong>. This is the Social Scientists' <i>Oath</i>--a line of decency. </p>\n<p>Tomorrow, Tuesday at noon, the world will tune in to hear Mark Zuckerberg's testimony before the U.S. Congress, all to hear about Facebook &amp; company's line of decency. However indecent any revelations may be, I'm not that entirely threatened by the revelations. Maybe I won't admit I'm   prone to Social Media influence, because I chart my course. Here's more from the esteemed Abbott: </p> \n\n<p class=\"quote\">“We have ended up believing that social reality is determined in the main by certain general forces, and that these generalities are then specified by combinations of forces, and further limited by various aspects of “individuality,” which in this sense is best understood as idiosyncratic higher order interaction.”<sup>1</sup> </p>\n<p>And so, while academic research focuses on the \"general forces\" to better understand how groups work together, the <strong>bad thing that Zuckerberg did</strong> is not following in the same spirit of generality.<sup>2</sup> They chose to collect and disseminate our \"likes\" as much as our locations, and ... wait for the ominous music ... the <i><strong>non-FB connected mobile contacts of the Facebook clients' personal cell-phones</strong></i>--flipping through someone's personal desk drawer is definitely pushing the rules of privacy. I addressed this issue in my <a href=\"#18-03-20\">March 20th blog post</a> on Facebook's ethics versus the long-standing data-handling ethics from Academia.

Humans flinch and humans swerve, because protecting fellow humans is in our DNA, not in A.I.'s.

This is because data and data research\n  is innate to the university's Mission Statement, whereas business and governmental institutions are relatively new\n  to the game, and often at odds with the\n  <i>Academy</i>, and occasionally against each other. </p>\n  <p class=\"quote\">Threats to student data privacy existed long before the internet. The FBI under J. Edgar Hoover infiltrated Berkeley\n  student groups to counter communism in the 1960s. Around the same time, the CIA manipulated the National Student\n  Association for intelligence gathering in other anti-communism efforts. But the privacy issue is more acute now\n  that the amount of student data in cloud-based systems has grown exponentially and is more widely dispersed.\n  <sup>2</sup>\n  </p>\n  <p> The University's expertise over ethically regulated data collection and management, is better than government, business,\n  and even medical domains for two reasons. First, the institution's long history and ethical motives with data are\n  unique. The norms of data-handling have been codified through the University's Institutional Review Board based\n  on its\n  <strong>stated mission</strong>. In other words, Universities take data seriously\n  <i>for reasons other than corporate profit or governmental control</i>. An example of personal data precautions has\n  played out with Harvard's recent data tiffs leading to the Supreme Court, illustrated by a 2016 article: </p>\n  <p class=\"quote\">Last week undergraduates at Harvard University raised concerns about the institution handing over their data to an\n  anti-affirmative action group as part of a lawsuit. Students for Fair Admissions, which is suing the university\n  for allegedly discriminating against Asian American applicants, will have access to “academic, extracurricular,\n  demographic and other information” from all undergrads who applied to Harvard between the fall 2009 and spring 2015,\n  omitting names and Social Security numbers.\n  <sup>2</sup>\n  </p>\n  <p>The second reason why Universities understand ethical implications for data is that data and more broadly data and\n  human information\n  <i>research</i> is the institutions' second highest priority, along with teaching and service. For example, in response\n  to the unethical Public Health research in\n  <i>Tuskegee Syphilis experiements</i>, the University instution\n  <i>stepped in</i> to help design the 1978\n  <strong>Belmont Principles</strong>. Currently, the University Institutional Review Board incorporates this with the Nuremburg\n  Code (developed after WWII NAZI research), in handling data research.\n  </p>\n  <p>In recent days,\n  <i>private companies</i> claim expertise for regulating \"Fake News\", and you guessed it,\n  <strong>regulation of data privacy &amp; confidentiality.</strong><sup>3</sup> The ethical authority over data privacy norms are nowhere\n  else than the University campus, case in point Harvard... Let the governments govern and the enterprises enterprise,\n  and leave the\n  <i>thoughtful, ethical regulation of data collection and precaution </i> to the Ivory Tower.

When we took a look at their\n  system, we found a serious vulnerability and textbook insecure code.\n  <br />\n  <br /> “In 2017, leaving your crypto algorithm vulnerable to differential cryptanalysis is a rookie mistake. It says that\n  no one of any calibre analyzed their system, and that the odds that their fix makes the system secure is low,” states\n  Bruce Schneier, renowned security technologist, about IOTA when we shared our attack.\n  <sup>3</sup>\n  </p>\n  <p>And so, with a 1.9 billion market cap, I sometimes have to reflect on the immensity and non-relational fact and figures\n  of our technological world!

Since all computer hardware today uses binary, IOTA converts to ternary in software, which is less efficient\n  and more complex. This complexity prevents IOTA from benefiting from existing security analysis tools that are designed\n  to work with binary, and makes the code harder to read and understand.\n  <br />\n  <br /> The current IOTA tangle requires a trusted party (the coordinator) for security, suggesting that in its current\n  form it’s not ready to run as a truly permissionless, decentralized system.\n  <sup>3</sup>\n  </p><p>\n  Optimizing, not sacrificing, should be the name of the game as Tech closes in on Blockchain challenges of security, scalability,\n  and that evers-so-costly\n  <strong>Sustainability!</strong>\n  </p>\n  <p>1.\n  <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-14/next-generation-crypto-ledgers-take-the-block-out-of-blockchain\"\n  target=\"_blank\">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-14/next-generation-crypto-ledgers-take-the-block-out-of-blockchain</a>\n  </p>\n  <p>2.\n  <a href=\"\n  https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-electricity-consumption-surpasses-singapore-portugal\n  \" target=\"_blank\"> https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-electricity-consumption-surpasses-singapore-portugal </a>\n  </p>\n  <p>3.\n  <a href=\"\n  https://medium.com/@neha/cryptographic-vulnerabilities-in-iota-9a6a9ddc4367\n  \" target=\"_blank\"> https://medium.com/@neha/cryptographic-vulnerabilities-in-iota-9a6a9ddc4367</a>\n  </p>\n  ",

While other nations have undertaken\n  big steps toward wind and solar - even China's pollution declined in 2014 for the first time\n  <sup>1</sup>. EU is now 30% renewable--from 12% in 2000 to expected 50% renewable energy by 2030\n  <sup>2</sup>. Us, it appears, not so much...ouch.</p>\n  <p>What can we do then, in our lives, to make our own contribution. Well, besides less fossil fuels and red meat, we\n  can choose our cryptocurrencies more conscientiously. One NY town's recent actions echo my own concerns about the\n  enormous carbon footprint of \"Proof-of-Work\" blockchain mining.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"quote\">\n  The city of Plattsburgh has put a moratorium on cryptocurrency mining to preserve natural resources, the health of its residents\n  and the city’s “character and direction,” officials said after a public hearing Thursday. For 18 months, the 20,000-resident\n  city will not consider new applications for commercial cryptocurrency mining. Violators will face fines of up to\n  $1,000 for each day they defy the moratorium.\n  <sup>3</sup>\n  </p>\n  <p>So, me too - count me out, I can't help but do the same, and pronounce my own refrain from Bitcoin (this is more\n  spiritual since I don't own, nor mine). In contrast, I'll put Ethereum on hold since they are transitioning to a\n  zero carbon-footprint by year's end. </p>\n  <p>And, for the most environmentally friendly cryptocurrencies, I wholly support Ripple (3rd highest valued cryptocurrency)\n  and also clean\n  <i>Iota</i> (8th highest valued )\n  <sup>5</sup>. Ripple, unfortunately, is a private company with a less-accessible internal distributed ledger.

And yet, this is the age-old-case of new technologies reshaping long-standing fields, especially\n  financial structure - the bottom line! All creative fields also have technological features on the horizon that\n  may, potentially move the playing field. First some recent background: </p>\n  <p class=\"quote\">\n  While [Taylor Swift] is certainly making money in retail sales and digital downloads, both of those metrics are spiraling\n  downward as people migrate away from the concept of owning music at all. Nielsen recently released numbers indicating\n  substantial drops in both CD and digital-track sales, which are down almost $100 million\n  <i>year over year</i> from 2014; streaming music continues to grow, but the revenue it generates isn’t close to making\n  up the difference, yet.\n  <sup>1</sup>\n  </p>\n  <p>Most remember Taylor Swift's 2014 industry-shaking album withdraw in protest to Spotify's payment structure. The\n  next year Taylor took on Apple iTunes--to which Apple bended to Taylor's Way\n  <sup>2</sup>. These wins are amazing but not enough, if only for winning battles in a losing war. </p>\n  <p class=\"quote\">Spotify is the future. Spotify is the enemy. Spotify doesn’t pay enough. Spotify is music’s best bet for revenue\n  growth. Since it arrived in the United States from Sweden in 2011, Spotify has been cast as both hero and villain\n  in the music industry’s continuing debate over streaming music. </p>\n  <p class=\"quote\">\n  It has been hailed as a potential savior through a two-tiered “freemium” model that would gradually lure listeners away from\n  piracy. Yet Spotify’s royalty rates have also terrified many artists already worried that each new step in music’s\n  digital evolution further devalues their work.\n  <sup>3</sup>\n  </p>\n  <p>So the trend looks dire, and yet is it really? Where, just where are the\n  <strong>Tech Platforms </strong> leading us? Tech is leading us\n  <i>nowhere</i>, at least not to one\n  <strong>singular, centralized place</strong>; rather, decentralized tech--including but not limited to blockchain--is busy\n  rewriting the boundaries between creators and consumers. This Tuesday's Forbes article reported on new subscription-based\n  model by Patreon. Still classical Web 2.0, it's novelty appears so simple, almost intuitive in potentially new pathway:</p>\n  <p class=\"quote\">\"On Kickstarter and Indiegogo, creators essentially have to start over every time,\" says Danny Rimer, a partner at\n  Index Ventures who is a Patreon investor and board member. \"It's the same reason software companies went from licensed\n  software to subscriptions: predictable revenue and better service for customers.\"\n  <sup>4</sup>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n  Apparently Patreon, along with last November's\n  <i>Drip</i> by KickStarter have made headway. Patreon paid out $150 million to its artists in 2017, and each are doubling\n  annually. Decentralizing again. Well, we say we can't\n  <i>go back to the way it was</i>, but Tech always seems to lead us back to the way it was!\n  </p>\n  <p>1.\n  <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/25/magazine/touring-cant-save-musicians-in-the-age-of-spotify.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/25/magazine/touring-cant-save-musicians-in-the-age-of-spotify.html\n  </a>\n  </p>\n  <p>2.\n  <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/taylor-swift-new-album-reputation-not-on-spotify-apple-music-streaming-2017-11\"\n  target=\"_blank\">http://www.businessinsider.com/taylor-swift-new-album-reputation-not-on-spotify-apple-music-streaming-2017-11\n  </a>\n  </p>\n  <p>3.\n  <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/12/business/media/taylor-swifts-stand-on-royalties-draws-a-rebuttal-from-spotify.html\"\n  target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/12/business/media/taylor-swifts-stand-on-royalties-draws-a-rebuttal-from-spotify.html\n  </a>\n  </p>\n  \n  \n  <p>4.\n  <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kathleenchaykowski/2018/02/13/digital-medici-how-this-musician-turned-entrepreneur-plans-to-save-creators-from-advertising/#6063ea771313\"\n  target=\"_blank\">https://www.forbes.com/sites/kathleenchaykowski/2018/02/13/digital-medici-how-this-musician-turned-entrepreneur-plans-to-save-creators-from-advertising\n  </a>\n  </p>\n  ",

Yet, the message more powerfully articulated than ever by adolescent-turns-adult\n  students, takes aim at something further afield. </p>\n  <p>Students, remembering the February 14th massacre victims, take aim at the corruption stemming from the 2010 Supreme\n  Court \"Person-hood\" protection for Corporations, also known as the\n  <i>Citizens United</i> Decision. A dated, but poignant, article from National Public Radio explains:\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"quote\">The Supreme Court extended that protection to corporations, and over time also extended some — but not all — of the\n  rights guaranteed to individuals in the Bill of Rights.\n  <sup>1</sup>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n  Yet, it appears deceptively harmless for Congressional Law-makers to protect corporations, in the form of\n  <strong>Gun Manufacturers' Lobbyists, </strong>\n  as equally as it protects humans.

No match against a sympathetic human,\n  yet the Corporation is given the same rights and privileges as the man in the street. Now, in the face of two decades'\n  dead humans--as young as\n  <i>Sandy Hook Elementary</i>, which were not protected by Legislation, due to commitments made to corporate lobbying.\n  </p>\n  <p>It appears increasingly difficult for Marco Rubio to accept money from gun lobbyists\n  <i>in exchange</i> for executing their legislation demands.

This is critically important to zero carbon-footprint.\n  For example, Bitcoin calculations drain more energy, 50 TeraWatt/hrs per year--higher than Singapore's 49.8!</p>\n  <p>Next, the primary security flaw of consensus-based leadership like Ripple, Iota (as opposed to\n  <i>random-selection blockchain leadership</i> based on carbon-intensive calculations) is they are susceptible to Hacking:\n  Denial-of-Service Attacks are possible because the next leader Block can be anticipated and followed by a Bot),\n  so the blockchain cycle is attacked at every cycle. </p>\n  <p>The Heder Hashgraph unveiled today overcomes this problem by using a 39-node-leader hashgraph data structure. Interestingly,\n  this is based on the original Visa Credit Card design from the 1950's (then called AmericaBank) for authenticating\n  system. </p>\n  <p>\n  Next, The Heder Hashgraph overcomes the problem of \"fairness\" because blockchain transactions are\n  <i>\n  <strong>not ordered in each cycle</strong>.</i> Bitcoin transactions are haphazardly lumped together in each block-cycle,\n  which is ~12 minutes. Which means that time-sensitive financial data queries will always lose! </p>\n  <p>\n  Swirld's unveiled their consensus-based\n  <strong>Hashgraph, a type of distributed ledger technology (DLT),</strong> last year. Today, it has now been announced to\n  deploy in late 2018 on the Hedera Hashgraph public network. This is tremendous news! Tremendous, since I explained\n  in my\n  <a href=\"#18-03-01\">March 1st </a> blog post that older blockchain technologies incentivize miners' efforts by directly tying electrical-cost(\n  (in calculations) to the Bitcoin/hour profit margin. For this reason, the future horizon just considerably shortened\n  Bitcoin's runway for establishing anything beyond \"early-adopter\" status. </p>\n  <p>So, we'll see if the innovating crew with Vitalik Buterin's Ethereum can successfully alter the crypto algorithm\n  into it's planned carbon-free consensus-based, \"proof-of-stake\" form.

Sharing economy refers to both democratized peer-to-peer\n  marketplaces,\n  <i>and</i> collaborative, resource-circulating consumption systems where the consumer&#39;s role is provider or obtainer\n  of resources. By either sense, the\n  <i>Uberized</i> economy is made possible by the underlying platform of Decentralized Technologies. Mobile social media,\n  internet, and blockchain tech creates the conditions needed for a convenient, community-based transactions.</p>\n  \n  <p>Bitcoin and Ethereum crypto-contracts grab the headlines, however it is the very nature of blockchain&#39;s\n  <i>distributed, i.e. shared, </i>ledger that revolutionizes how humans interact, and how they exchange and share goods\n  and services. So, how might a transactional, zero-sum Market Economy merge with a Sharing Economy?</p>\n  \n  <p>In\n  <i>The Third Industrial Revolution, </i>Social and Economic theorist, Dr. Jeremy Rifkin, provides insight into how\n  the\n  <strong>Sharing Economy can grow alongside the traditional Market Economy</strong>.\n  <sup>1</sup> The theory argues three (3) breakthroughs are needed to create the conditions necessary for a new &quot;general\n  purpose technological platform,&quot; and thus an Industrial Revolution. They are management/commmunication of power,\n  sources of new power/energy, and the transportation of this power.</p>\n  \n  <p>The first condition: New forms of communication to\n  <i>manage</i> power, for example steam-powered printing press, trans-oceanic telegraph, then later telephone. The second\n  condition: New energy sources, for example steam-engine using coal and other fossil fuels. The third condition:\n  New methods to transport energy, i.e. the steam engine on rails, then later fossil fuel vehicles.</p>\n  \n  <p>So what&#39;s new about today? 5G Cellular technology coupled with decentralized, blockchain internet; Second, improving\n  solar &amp; wind power coupled with decentralized, bi-directional energy grid; and third, transporation by automatated,\n  driverless shipping for example. So, why is this important, even vital to adapt a new paradigm that fits the new\n  technology? exponential populstion growth and exponential climate changes are top of the list.</p>\n  \n  <p>Britain&#39;s innovations with steam &amp; coal characterized the first Industrial Revolution, and America&#39;s\n  innovations in telephones, oil-fueled vehicles, and centralized transportation grid, however the innovations in\n  the present era are much quicker than previous eras... which means we as a society can embrace more proactively\n  the New Paradigm needed to adapt.</p>\n  \n  <p>So, how can we change the way we\n  <i>think</i> and how we\n  <i>react</i> depends on our worldview, and how deeply entrenched. Thomas Kuhn&#39;s 2004 publication on\n  <strong>\n  <i>The Structure of Scientific Revolution</i>\n  </strong>\n  <sup>3</sup> explains how society will drag its feet in the face of change, and only after decades of controversy will\n  a New Paradigm Shift emerge. In this occasion however, we as a society may not have the luxury of decades to adapt\n  to New Technologies, as the carbon hangover from the previous Industrial Era imperils the safe arrival of the next!</p>\n  \n  <p>&nbsp;</p>\n  \n  <p>1.\n  <a href=\"https://www.foet.org/books/the-third-industrial-revolution/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.foet.org/books/the-third-industrial-revolution/</a>\n  </p>\n  \n  <p>2.\n  <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/node/21553017\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.economist.com/node/21553017</a>\n  </p>\n  \n  <p>3.\n  <a href=\"https://projektintegracija.pravo.hr/_download/repository/Kuhn_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions.pdf\"\n  target=\"_blank\">3.

This means that every institution, whether private hospitals, non-profit charity\n  foundations, or government bureaus, will effectively restructure (optimize) their own organizational structure in\n  an increasingly\n  <i>data-driven</i> paradigm. From a Sociology of Organizations perspective, the changes to come are breath-taking to\n  consider.</p>\n  \n  <p>So why women? Where could I start? Better stated, why is a quintessentially important job sector, a sector in desperate\n  need for insight, comprised primarily of men?\n  <sup >1</sup> The facts are evident: ~15-20% of women comprising tech positions.\n  <sup  >2</sup> Numbers aside, I argue there is a quintessential societal need for more women in tech: This is because computing\n  and understanding data has changed since the data collection from Web 2.0 (mobile), becoming more networked and\n  relational.</p>\n  \n  <p>The challenge for society in this age is historic, and women must absolutely be included in the process of the age:\n  Please consider, that in the 1650&#39;s, the invention of the microscope opened a new world of data and\n  <i>information</i> about the bacteriological, microscopic surroundings--hitherto blind to all. Likewise, the telescope\n  has allowed us as a society to explore the outer universe and earth&#39;s position within it.</p>\n  \n  <p>Now, the inventions of machine-learning, computing coupled with Big Data analytics, allows us to explore (and manage)\n  a universe of knowledge--about\n  <i>ourselves</i>, human society--with unfathomably complex, unstructured relational data structures. Accessing the\n  data to computer-readable form is one thing, but meaning in data is inaccessible until the\n  <i>output</i> can be\n  <i>re-</i>programmed into meaningful, human-readable data, i.e. information. This latter stage of development is the\n  key challenge--for which success depends on representative female participation in Tech.</p>\n  \n  <p>Adding to the challenge of finding meaningful trends is the backdrop of noise from spurious variables. This is akin\n  to finding a needle in an increasingly complex and growing haystack.</p>\n  \n  <p class=\"quote\">What&#39;s different now and has changed is it&#39;s no longer about taking this data, putting it into a computer\n  running a calculation and getting a balance sheet answer ...</p>\n  \n  <p class=\"quote\">What&#39;s important now is what is the context of the data, what is it connected to, what effect is it having on\n  data around it... It&#39;s basically a network of the data, it&#39;s no longer sort of tabular columns, of rows\n  of data, it&#39;s\n  <i>interconnected patterns</i>.\n  <br /> --Tim Cook</p>\n  \n  <p>This quote means that as we move away from rule-based, mechanistic data analytics toward more complex, relational\n  and networked data, we need an equally complex paradigm to keep up. Excluding the female mind from this challenge\n  is not simply a clumsy, myopic mistake. Worse yet, so long as the Tech Industry remains gender lop-sided, Tech will\n  increasingly resemble another myopic beast, a cave-dweller named Cyclops.</p>\n  \n  <p>1.\n  <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/27/women-in-tech_n_6955940.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/27/women-in-tech_n_6955940.html</a>\n  </p>\n  \n  <p>2.\n  <a href=\"https://fairygodboss.com/articles/women-in-tech-facts-figures-and-percentages\" target=\"_blank\">https://fairygodboss.com/articles/women-in-tech-facts-figures-and-percentages</a>\n  </p>\n  \n  <p>3.\n  <a href=\"https://www.aauw.org/research/why-so-few/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.aauw.org/research/why-so-few/</a>\n  </p>\n  ",

          "post": "<p class=\"firstparagraph\">Germs present a timely topic for today, given the especially virulent\n  <strong>Flu Virus strain</strong>. Many, like me, have wondered why our 1940&#39;s-era\n  <sup>1</sup> technology in Flu Vaccine fabrication wouldn&#39;t invite more innovative solutions. Without feigning any\n  medical expertise, I have to still ask about the progress made with the ever-mutating--i.e., drifting--Flu virus&#39;\n  surface protein &quot;head,&quot; called hemaglutinin. This strategy &quot;guesses right&quot; very effectively,\n  and provides an effective solution for most, in most years. Yet this winter has revealed that effectiveness statistics\n  are\n  <i>not always</i> in our favor.</p>\n  \n  <p class=\"quote\">For many decades, researchers believed the flu vaccine offered solid protection if it was a good match to the circulating\n  strains; studies from the 1940s through the 1960s routinely showed an efficacy of 70% to 90%. But those studies\n  relied on a misleading methodology.</p>\n  \n  <p class=\"quote\">Danuta Skowronski, an epidemiologist at the BC Centre for Disease Control in Vancouver, Canada, instead blames mutations\n  in the vaccine strain itself. The most common influenza vaccine contains an &quot;inactivated&quot; virus, which\n  manufacturers grow in chicken eggs. As Skowronski&#39;s team first reported in 2014, the virus can mutate while\n  it is growing in the eggs, resulting in a vaccine unable to block circulating strains.\n  <sup>1</sup>\n  </p>\n  \n  <p>Earlier, I casually mentioned &quot;guessing&quot;, yet with great respect, the science behind estimating the flu\n  virus between the time of R &amp; D, fabrication, and the flu\n  <i>season</i>. (This antigenic drift, not to be confused with\n  <i>Antigenic Shift</i> in which the Flu Virus makes an abrupt change.) I&#39;ll let the CDC abbreviate this:</p>\n  \n  <p class=\"quote\">One way they change is called &ldquo;antigenic drift.&rdquo; These are small changes in the genes of influenza viruses\n  that happen continually over time as the virus replicates. These small genetic changes usually produce viruses that\n  are pretty closely related to one another, which can be illustrated by their location close together on a phylogenetic\n  tree. Viruses that are closely related to each other usually share the same antigenic properties and an immune system\n  exposed to an similar virus will usually recognize it and respond\n  <sup>2</sup>.</p>\n  \n  <p>So, ultimately, the strategy is to estimate the form, location, of that virus--what it will look like--at a particular\n  period each year. This implicates a strategy to estimate the trajectory, stage by stage, of this virus, i.e. a longitudinal\n  time-series morphology, each year. The article makes this point more precise:</p>\n  \n  <p class=\"quote\">But these small genetic changes can accumulate over time and result in viruses that are antigenically different (further\n  away on the phylogenetic tree). When this happens, the body&rsquo;s immune system may not recognize those viruses.\n  <sup>2</sup>\n  </p>\n  \n  <p>Petri dishes aside, let&#39;s focus on the changing nature of the Flu Virus, which makes itself a\n  <i>research </i>challenge in itself because of an ever-mutating object of study. Yet, this ever-changing nature also\n  provides the very tool Statisticians need most for estimating: Big Data. The Law of Large Numbers means that plain\n  math can accurately plot, and in most cases predict with a moderate statistical significance, future events, sort\n  of.</p>\n  \n  <p>Sort of I say because too often we predict that two separate events are more likely to occur, conditional on each\n  other, then conditional upon other factors. This being\n  <i>correlation</i>, but the Statistician&#39;s Holy Grail is the other kind: Causality. Causality hinges on only thre3e\n  things: 1) Association, 2) Time Precedence, and 3) Ruling out any\n  <i> effect</i> of spurious variables. (Hang with me, I&#39;m still getting back to the subject of our annual predictions\n  about a few months&#39; worth of antigenic drift.)</p>\n  \n  <p>Therefore, Big data, and new advances in the statistical sciences, and the technology that increasingly defines our\n  sciences, may soon refine and supercharge research into the first and third of the three points of causality. The\n  first of these, the associations, along the phylogenetic tree, are merely a network at its base, the science of\n  which gains computational strength each year. Rare as it is in Academia, in this case Might makes Right!</p>\n  \n  <p>\n  The third tenet of causality, after association and time direction, is ruling out the effect of other factors when separating\n  <i>cause</i> and consequence. Advances in managing big data, and statistical analysis of it, means gaining a better\n  handle on the multiple effects of\n  <sup>spurious </sup>factors, hence analysis optimized by new, network-graph data structure technology. The Law of Large\n  Numbers\n  <sup>3</sup>, i.e. the sheer number of mutations and other factors, coupled with new\n  <strong>technology</strong>, will better inform the morphology of the\n  <i>path</i> of the virus, along the phylogenetic tree itself. Who knows where a cure may come from, perhaps a bio-statistician\n  out there, churning the numbers, may be the one to stumble upon a better Flu Vaccine!\n  \n  </p>\n  <p>1.\n  <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/09/why-flu-vaccines-so-often-fail\" target=\"_blank\"> http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/09/why-flu-vaccines-so-often-fail </a>\n  </p>\n  \n  <p>2.\n  <a href=\"https://qz.com/1143420/the-2017-2018-flu-vaccine-is-less-effective-than-usual\" target=\"_blank\"> https://qz.com/1143420/the-2017-2018-flu-vaccine-is-less-effective-than-usual </a>\n  </p>\n  \n  <p>3.\n  <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/viruses/change.htm\" target=\"_blank\"> https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/viruses/change.htm </a>\n  </p>\n  ",

This problem, experienced by\nthe top two crypto-currencies Bitcoin and Ethereum, is that the\n<i>monetary</i> value of the currency is matched to the\n<i>computing difficulty</i>--measured either by how much the computer is sweating, or by electricity KiloWatt Hours\nper year.\n<sup>1</sup> Digiconomist succinctly writes:</p>\n\n<p class=\"quote\">The continuous block mining cycle incentivizes people all over the world to mine Bitcoin. As mining can provide a\nsolid stream of revenue, people are very willing to run power-hungry machines to get a piece of it. Over the years\nthis has caused the total energy consumption of the Bitcoin network to grow to epic proportions, as the price of\nthe currency reached new highs.\n<sup>2</sup>\n</p>\n\n<p>And, so the issue I&#39;m addressing is a side-effect of the deepening incentivization for miners to invest more\nequipment, and in turn, more electricity. The article goes on to report Bitcoin&#39;s surpassing 50 TeraWatt-Hours-per-year\nusage has surpassed that of Portugal and Singapore, which are 49.5 TWh per year, and 49.8 TWh per year, respectively.\nIn other words, the usage by the Bitcoin miner&#39;s cost (in electricity) compared with the miner&#39;s gain (in\nBitcoins accrued by incentivized mining) drives up and incentives a deeper Carbon Footprint.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"quote\">Fueled by a meteoric rise in the Bitcoin price over the past few months, the power usage of the Bitcoin network has\nbeen increasing at a feverish pace. Just a little over three months ago, at the start of November 2017, the Bitcoin\nEnergy Consumption Index was estimating the total electricity consumption of the Bitcoin network to be half of the\ncurrent amount. On the first day of November, the estimated consumption was equal to 24.3 TWh per year.\n<sup>1</sup>\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCarbon Footprint, measured in this way, equates as a double-edged sword: The miner&#39;s electricity costs account for approximately\n65% of the profit (Bitcoin units&#39; value, measured when mined). So the\n<i>economic </i>usage means the cheapest available fuel is part of the business model--and it would lead to the cost\nof the cheapest source of energy: Dirty Coal. At the end of the day, if the\n<i>currency&#39;s </i>rising value means that more computationally-intensive mining is more and more profitable, then\nperhaps the other edge looks preferred!\n</p>\n\n<p>1.\n<a href=\"\nhttps://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-electricity-consumption-surpasses-singapore-portugal\n\" target=\"_blank\"> https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-electricity-consumption-surpasses-singapore-portugal </a>\n</p>\n\n<p>2.\n<a href=\"\nhttps://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption\n\" target=\"_blank\"> https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption </a>\n</p>\n",

Amazing, and the two occurred nearly simultaneously\n  as I worked on them, their paths crossed and poof, gone! Same platform, and I paid the price! Whether I change my\n  ways is yet to be seen, but I shall continue with my original theme for the day, namely, Sustainability, a.k.a.\n  Carbon Footprint.</p>\n  \n  <p class=\"quote\">Power consumption is one of the major costs of bitcoin mining, as dedicated machines crunch the algorithms that build\n  a record of every single bitcoin transaction and are rewarded with tiny fractions of a bitcoin for their efforts.\n  <sup >1</sup>\n  </p>\n  \n  <p>Today I have a mild Critique and Praise for the blockchain sustainability problem caused by sky-high electricity\n  bills! Computer algorithms do waste electricity, not like your Widescreen. More electricity is gobbled up by small\n  and large mining operations in nearly every country than small nations!\n  <sup >1</sup>. Ethereum, Bitcoin and a handful of other &quot;Proof-of-Work&quot; designs require electricity because\n  the investment in equipment itself is investment, but more importantly, two-way incentivation for mining drives\n  the system, and the scarcity demand through difficulty computations.</p>\n  \n  <p>So, is the electricity consumption really\n  <i>correlated</i> with the value, scarcity, of the currency? Yes. Digiconomist--a cryptocurrency analysis site\n  <sup\n  id=\"digiconomist\">3</sup> estimates\n  <i>each</i>Ethereum transaction represents a 45 Kilowatt-hour of electricity&#39;s mining. (A visa credit card transaction\n  is 0.00651 kWh. The entire Ethereum global blockchain could be &quot;using as much as 4.2 Terawatt-hours (tWh),\n  or slightly more than the country of Cyprus\n  <sup  >1</sup>.&quot; So, electricity comparisons are telling, but how does this relate to its environment impact, sustainability\n  itself?</p>\n  \n  <p>Carbon Footprint, our energy consumption index, can be compared to another element of scarcity, which dictates fluctuations\n  in value: Gold. According to\n  <i>Digiconomist</i>, an average household&#39;s Carbon Footprint is about 10 tons of CO2 per year. The article does\n  the math for us very succinctly:</p>\n  \n  <p class=\"quote\">On top of this, we can find that the process of mining Bitcoin isn&rsquo;t just more energy-intensive, but also has\n  a bigger environmental impact. To reach that conclusion, we first need to estimate the carbon footprint for both.\n  For Bitcoin we can, again, get this number from the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index. For gold, we assume a carbon\n  footprint of 20 tons of CO2e per every kilogram of gold mined\n  <sup >3</sup>.</p>\n  \n  <p>The article continues to clarify that 33,000 kilograms of CO2 per unit mines (comparatively, one Bitcoin&#39;s worth\n  of Gold is 4,000 kilograms of CO2). At the end of the day, the electricity costs--if not sustainable long-term--could\n  spell trouble. Hence, the three S&#39;s, mentioned last, sustainability is perhaps a larger issue than blockchain\n  Security and Scalability challenges.

Well, I had begun my blog with intentions about the accelerated speed of language and syntax formation,\n  and the curious phenomenon I&#39;d call, for lack of a better word or or my own reading, &quot;declarative-syntax-merging&quot;.\n  This involves the curious, and largely unknown, growth of JavaScript scripting language into almost every domain\n  of web apps, data analysis, and even the bounds of\n  <i>Logic</i> itself. Though I won&#39;t submit my readers to a history of a language, suffice it to say that, &quot;If\n  a certain algorithm, device, or object is programmable, then it will eventually be programmed in JavaScript.&quot;</p>\n  \n  <p>Without getting into technicals, I&#39;ll instead use a perfect metaphor--the manner by which English merged with\n  French, beginning with the conquests of William of Normandy, around 1096 onward. Almost a thousand years later,\n  we can see how English grammar inherited it&#39;s Anglo-Saxon Linguistic roots, along with the core vocabulary;\n  Then, as English vocabulary moves past the first few thousand core words, e.g. &quot;milk&quot; or &quot;house&quot;\n  from &quot;melche&quot; or &quot;haus&quot;, then more than 70% of English Vocabulary is directly inherited from\n  French, e.g. &quot;lactose&quot; or &quot;mansion&quot; from &quot;lait&quot; or &quot;maison&quot;.</p>\n  \n  <p>Similarly, the language of the web and original browsers, JavaScript, has similarly morphed into a new language called\n  Solidity, but in only a micro-fraction of English&#39;s time. The usual FOMO logic propels coding language use,\n  for example FOMO induced Microsoft&#39;s flagship Text Editor, Visual Code, to adopt it years ago.\n  <sup >1</sup> The language of Ethereum Blockchain is Solidity, which like the above example, has two parents, one non-legitimate.\n  It is in all respects totally JavaScript, yet with object-oriented elements of C++. For the layperson, let&#39;s\n  just say Solidity resembles a &quot;Liger&quot;, in it is at it&#39;s core JavaScript, yet with increasing sophistication\n  based on C++ logic, its head and torso has begun to resemble the powerful machine-code of C++ ever more.

In fact,\nmany queries are impossible, due to unprescient database schema architectures. Next, with the need to &quot;objectify&quot;\ndata into non-relational objects, rather than an antiquated, rigid row-and-column design. Thus, the second major\ntype of data structure is more flexible and adept in finding these relational queries that are ever more in vogue.\nHowever, the crystal-like, pristine non-relational, No-SQL designs quickly turn to spaghetti, and are poor for scalability.\nBetween a rock and a hard place, a third data structure has emerged in recent years.</p>\n\n<p>Graph Data Structures\n<sup>2</sup> allow data queries that had otherwise been impossible to capture in an entity relationship diagram. The\nideal example to clarify is the manner that the Swiss banks&#39; accounts were discovered to be hiding vast amounts\nof hidden taxes, etc. The cover-up was so well-constructed that not until new, graph database queries discovered\npatterns of money flow\n<sup>1</sup>:</p>\n\n<p class=\"quote\">The data was then turned into a graph format to detect then fine-tune the connections between the nodes.

Thus, new and upcoming needs in domains\nlike content management &amp; access control, geo-routing (public transportation), gene sequencing, bio-informatics,\nand so on.

Then, the primacy of the\n<i>Scientific Method</i> from the Renaissance forward--punctuated first by Copernican Heliocentrism, then other Paradigm\nShifts--has directed rational and ethical norms in each respective period, e.g. Enlightenment authors of 17th, 18th\ncentury. Fast forward to the modern period, wherein the current era&#39;s emerging paradigm holds Sharing as a collective-priority\nand responsibility, then an amazing philosophical moment.\n<i>Historical Materialism</i>\n<sup>2</sup> prescribes what is directly here a novel Paradigm Shift by which authority is not derived from governmental,\nfinancial sources, but rather the\n<i>shared</i>societal consensus about cryptographic, mathematical proofs as true authority. Further, the revolutionary\nshift also innately provides tools for implemention through decentralized, programmable data-sharing. Cryptography\nhas in a sense become a\n<i>de jure</i> middle-person for identification and verification of property.</p>\n\n<p>\n<strong>I. Protecting rights through immutable records</strong>\n<br /> Inalieable Rights can now be identified and verified by the cryptographic authority of a mathematical proof, rather\nthan exclusively through governmental or financial institutions from above. The modern period also has held this\ndecentralized, individual authority as the\n<i>a priori</i> starting points for philosophical proofs. Premises about truth begin with the conditions of humankind,\nnot idealogies. In fact, it was the\n<i>Young Hegelians</i> of early 19th century Vienna &amp; Berlin, who ushered in the Modern Era of Western Philosophy,\nby laying out Truth as inverted, beginning from the empirical &quot;ground&quot; upward. This &quot;upside-down\ntree&quot; defines philosophical modernity. Jean-Paul Sartre wrote that the whole of\n<i>Existentialism</i> and 20th century philsophy is a mere subset, and never escapes Continental Materialism, as argued\nin Sartre&#39;s\n<i>Search for a Method</i>.\n<sup>3</sup>\n</p>\n\n<p>All of the Sciences, prodded by this Truth of Empiricism, followed suit through all the tech innovations since Hegel.\nI&#39;m so surprised by this, because for me, the role of cryptography is shocking on two levels. First, cryptography\nresemblees philosophy rather than the Empiricism that I had envisioned would govern social rule (Some once thought\nnuclear sciences held this role--no longer! Mathematics takes the crown. Secondly, I&#39;m still dumbfounded that\na Paradigm Shift\n<i>first</i> offers the tools to fulfill itself? Staggering to consider the arbitrary changes ahead for a society that\nis provided the tools of social structural change first, but how quite convenient!</p>\n\n<p>\n<strong>II. Bureaucratic Atomization in a True Sharing Economy</strong>\n</p>\n\n<p>It is satisfyingly reassuring to see the good-natured, altruistic efforts among the thousands, upon thousands of\nopen-source volunteers, and blockchain innovators, like Vitalik Buterin author of Ethereum Virtual Machine, whose\naims and efforts make staggering progress each quarter. The potential for removing the &quot;middle-person&quot;\nfrom the day-to-day, micro-economic &quot;cost of living&quot;. This goes for for the exchanging of titles, legal\ndocuments, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Sharing of Resources is, in my personal opinion, critical to global future--both out of increasing necessity in allocating\nincreasingly limited resources; an arbitrary rearrangement of\n<i>Social Structure</i> and distribution of its resources. While the exponential population growth looms on the near\nhorizon, a clear, pre-existing solution begins with a focus on\n<i>smart</i>, effective sharing of resources. The driving principle of sustainability is made convenient by means of\nblockchain technology, extending for example to local economies, cooperatives, ride-sharing, etc.</p>\n\n<p>\n<strong>III. Removing Double-Dipping from International Remittances </strong>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n<i>&quot;Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.&quot;\n</i>\n<br /> --Antoine de Saint-Exup&eacute;ry, 1939</p>\n\n<p>Taxes and tariffs are difficult enough, the double-dipping of the current international remittance system, &aacute;\nla Western Union, does not reflect the global, sharing Economy of 2018. The existing remittance system (not speaking\nto\n<i>centralized</i>, middle-man alternatives like PayPay, etc.)--supposing if I wire $2 Loonie to a Canadian friend&#39;s\nCanadian Bank--requires payments executed through two separate bank transactions in two national payments systems,\nthus the sending country and receiving country each take a cut.

However, if the current logistical obstacles provide controversy and competing algorithms\nover sustainability, security, and scalability, then they reveal much more about the general pathway of social uses\n(and potential effects) than they hide. In my February 15th\n<a href=\"#18-02-15\">blog</a>, I touched on a few features of micro-economic uses so as to distinguish the more certain aspects of the\ncrypto-contract horizon.</p>\n\n<p>\n<strong>Prologue</strong>\n</p>\n\n<p>So, what are some core features of block-chain technology that affect the quality of our lives, and the\n<i>productivity</i> of our work as a society of academics, public-sector and private-sector professionals? First, a\nlittle background and context before I outline seven blockchain functionalities. The Ethereum blockchain helps distinguish\nitself--and its blockchain-native language Solidity--from earlier tech, like Bitcoin and other Proof of Work-based\nblockchains. Ethereum blockchain offers a syntax and programming features, e.g. &quot;looping&quot;, &quot;recursion&quot;,\nwith the full power of a\n<i>Turing Complete</i> language--that is, given enough resources, the language can solve any programmable problem.</p>\n\n<p>More background and a clarifying metaphor are in order: The Bitcoin blockchain transaction resembles the accounting\nsystem of a foos-ball table point rack with a basic calculator glued to the side. In contradistinction, An Ethereum\nblockchain transaction would resemble a network of computers,\n<i>which is itself,</i> a computer--hence, the name Ethereum Virtual Machine. This allows for Quickbooks to calculate\ninto a PDF to be sent via an email contract-signing program. Much more useful!</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, Ethereum&#39;s Blockchain is more than a networked, chained list of blocks, like Bitcoin. The Ethereum\nblockchain is actually a &quot;Virtual Machine&quot;, like a a big networked &quot;home computer&quot;. The native\nlanguage of the blockchain, Solidity, allows for an\n<i>application binary interface</i>, ABI. So, for example, I can type up an Ethereum contract on my home computer,\nthen directly access by command line the blockchain itself. In layman&#39;s terms, the manner that modern-day app,\nfor example Instagram, is a centralized API (Application Programming Interface) that allows one programming system\nto interact with another, such as Instragram offers a &quot;sharing API&quot; that connects to hardware contacts,\nthus facitilating communicating with third-party aplications, like sharing your instagram picture to your Facebook\naccount, via your T-Mobile phone&#39;s contacts list. This API relationship broadly describes the modern world we\nlive in, wherein a Chryser driving system exchanges API information with your T-Mobile Bluetooth network system,\nwhich exchanges API information with your own contact list, and so on, and our lives are made easier.</p>\n\n<p>So, are we out of the woods? Has Ethereum solved the blockchain question? Yes, if it were the 1920 pre-relativity\ndays; However, with the advent of quantum computing, potential security vulnerabilities immediately arise. The reason\nbeing that digital math uses binary &quot;on/off&quot; calculations, while quantum math implicates a tertiary,\n<i>qubit</i> &quot;simultaneous states&quot;. Therefore, we have now entered the 3rd generation of blockchain technology,\nboth programmable, but also quantum-proof due to mathematical graph features. For example, IOTA&#39;s blockchain\ndesign utilizes a\n<i>Winternitz One-Time Signature</i>, by which one&#39;s transaction is entered into with a private-key, and the blockchain\nmoreso resembles a &quot;Tangle&quot; of a directed graph, which allows for computational &quot;states&quot;. IOTA\nrecently garnered criticism in January 2018 due to an unfortunate crypto-hack, that exposed an apparent vulnerability.\nIn truth, this was a case of user-error because users were\n<i>re-using</i> their one-time keys, which significantly decreases security to the point that a home computer could\ncrack the code! I choose to not digress further, and quantum computing is not quite advanced enough now to cause\ndamage, but in the future could potentially split the blockchain in two, or other quantum possibilities.</p>\n\n<p>In sum, the technical obstacles change each month, however one must not lose sight of the forest for the trees. Social\nuseablity, potential scope and of course unintended consequences have all finally begun to emerge, at least in form,\nwith little difference between the 2nd generation blockchain or the 3rd generation Patrician directed graph blockchain.\nThe underlying principle of the blockchain&#39;s micro-economic utiliity through crypto-\n<i>contracts</i> is the same, as opposed to plain crypto-currency. you know the usual bartering solutions for Supply\n&amp; Demand leading to Economics Game Theory, etc. This is where we must take our leave of the Hard Sciences of\nMathematics, and enter the realm of Sociology, Psychology, Anthropology and Economics.</p>\n  ",

Sure, it&#39;s more\nof a &quot;metropolitan&quot; phenomenon; and sure, it&#39;s become an accepted global platform--along with myriad\nother crypto-currencies, but it&#39;s exchange-worthiness remains shrowded, and misunderstood by many. Cryptocurrencies\nare useful as a vehicle for investment, and yes, there are Bitcoin millionaires due to the currency&#39;s rise to\nfame with last year&#39;s increase in value (from $1,000 to ~$20,000) etc., etc. But, so far its contributions,\nuses, fame are one-sidedly\n<i>macro-</i>economic. A recent CNET article\n<sup>1</sup>, among others, documents miniscule (and not improving) percentage of\n<i>actual</i> use at the &quot;cash-registers&quot; of society.</p>\n\n<p>Is there something wrong with such little micro-economic usage? Not at all! According to general sociological\n<i>Early Adopter</i> theory--based on Everett M. Rogers&#39;\n<i>Diffusion of Innovations</i>\n<sup>2</sup>--the timeline of the Innovation Adoption Lifecycle is fairly ordinary. That is, the Roger&#39;s bell curve\nranges from the beginning innovators, to early adopters, early majority, and late majority. However, the blockchain\narticles always miss the point. Currencies are more of a distraction compared to the genuine usefulness for the\nevery-person, in every-day affairs, on a given day--i.e., micro-economic use.</p>\n\n<p>The true value, the kind that makes our lives easier on any given day, and for the every-person, is\n<i>not</i> the currency, it is the contract, that allows for individualized, targeted sharing of specific information--whether\nfinancial, governmental, or any other centralized database. An example is in order before I continue, since we can\nall relate to the risk of using a credit or debit card, the risk most notably concerning Target store credit card\nhacks a couple years ago.</p>\n\n<p>Suppose a person shops at 3 different retailers, using a different credit card for each. For these 3 transactions,\nthis person had only needed to provide two discrete pieces of information about themselves for each transaction:\nthey prove they have the $27, $200, and $5; and they prove a third party(i.e.,CC or bank)will make that $27, $200,\nor $5 available, if their client agrees. Instead, for each transaction, they open their\n<i>entire</i> financial information, and can only hope that law-enforcement will prevent cyber-theft; and if the store&#39;s\ndatabases are hacked, then tough-luck!</p>\n\n<p>Crypto-contracts provide the technology for this individualized, risk-free transaction, rather than for each transaction,\nproviding the generalized information for individual transaction. Highly inefficient! Nobody thinks to walk around\nwith their life-savings in cash, then at the 7-11 store, to open their wad of cash and peel out a bill. The credit\ncard system, blessed as it is, did not previously have technology to avoid this very thing. So, financial institutions\nhave had to rely on the many layers of security, passwords, pins, mothers&#39; maiden names, etc. Then, based on\nthe mathematics behind prime numbers, they hope to keep your money safe in one, centralized spot--with a bright\nred target on it.</p>\n\n<p>Now, the crypto-contract provides this decidedly *micro-economic* experience for the everyday person. And that, my\nfriends, has nothing to do with crypto-currencies. There is no micro-economic value in crypto-currency, instead\nthe crypto-\n<i>contract</i> is the true, unsung hero, and a hero we will all get to know. [personal opinion - this hero&#39;s name\nis the Ethereum Virtual Machine]. In any case, Crypto-contracts provide this ability to provide pinpointed,\n<i>specific, targeted information</i> as citizens, too. When we provide our drivers license number, for the sake of\nrenting that car, we provide every aspect of information of ourselves to Hertz. They don&#39;t need this. They need\nto know only and exclusively driving-record related details--not the entire governmental database of information\nabout you!</p>\n\n<p>1.\n<a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-big-in-investing-but-still-lousy-for-buying-a-sandwich/\"\ntarget=\"_blank\">https://www.cnet.com/news/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-big-in-investing-but-still-lousy-for-buying-a-sandwich/</a>\n</p>\n\n<p>2.\n<a href=\"https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED065999\" target=\"_blank\">Rogers, E.

Borkan explains:</p>\n\n<p class=\"quote\">It&#39;s time for us to take a leap forward in educating physicians for the health care delivery models of the future&mdash;those\nthat aim to improve not just the health of the individual patient and their family, but also the community and the\npopulation.\n<sup>4</sup>\n</p>\n\n<p>What, then, specifically, are the mechanisms that a community network&#39;s aggregated health may be inextricably\ntied up with\n<i>our own</i> individual health? In short, they are the sharing of health-promoting resources, timely assistance,\nhealth-promoting information channels -- all this, among the countless perks of a healthy social circle!</p>\n\n<p class=\"citations\">1.\n<a href=\"http://www.greekmedicine.net/whos_who/The_Hippocratic_Oath.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Oath of Hippocrates</a>\n<br /> 2.\n<a href=\"https://students-residents.aamc.org/applying-medical-school/article/changing-mcat-exam/\" target=\"_blank\">The 2015 AAMA Changes to the Medical College Admissions Test</a>\n<br /> 3.\n<a href=\"https://www.ama-assn.org/education/teaching-new-content-health-systems-science\" target=\"_blank\">American Medical Association&#39;s\n<i>Teaching New Content Health Systems Science</i>\n</a>\n<br /> 4.\n<a href=\"https://www.ama-assn.org/education/teaching-new-content-health-systems-science\" target=\"_blank\">ibid.</a>\n</p>\n  ",

Rather, arbitrary mathematical forces created abnormal,\nnever-before-seen network structural density and symmetry patterns. Technological shifts were so efficient at multiplying\nand exacerbating misinformation because a curious sociological network phenomenon rendered parts of our daily social\nlearning and acculturating process to network forces out of our own control.</p>\n\n<p>A January 2016 American Sociology Association Newsletter Editorial\n<sup> 2</sup> from Sally T. Hillsman, in which she explained how the social mechanisms of our own misinformation were\nnot entirely within our own control to resist. In fact, the arbitrary (often random) social structural changes from\nhigher social-media hours, create an arbitrary social network structure whose links (in their content and influence)\nbegin to dominate over nodes (each of us). In other words, the sway of trends and opinionated critical thought becomes\ndominated by the relationships, e.g., the &quot;likes&quot; and &quot;shares&quot;, leading to a statistically natural\npropensity toward homogeneity--a.k.a. group-think. The mechanism is akin to peacefully swimming close and parallel\nto the coastline, and (due to random coastal floor structure), a rip-tide suddenly ships you far out to sea--a fatal\nand tragic fate rendering experienced swimmers out of their own control. Same principle with an arbitrary\n<i>underlying and unseen</i> network structure.</p>\n\n<p>Our social network structures always are prone to continual shift, and so the usual &quot;interruptions&quot; that\npreviously stopped this inward shift soon began to disappear. Hillsman explains:</p>\n\n<p class=\"quote\">Lies, half-truths, and misinformation spread so rapidly across the public through digital communication that the\ntimespan for thoughtful, effective correction or rebuttal is infinitesimal. Because of confirmation Bias, misinformation\nand outright lies quickly strengthen preconceived truths or pre-held beliefs that are already hard to change.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, even though we all have been pointedly warned,\n<i> none of us</i> without advanced sociological analysis skills could understand that a curious network phenomonenon--ultimately\ndriven by some arbitrary mathematical calculation involving size, density, symmetry, conditional influences, and\nthe strength of ties outweighing network nodes. For the reasons of these factors, our social inclinations were\n<i>out of our control</i> -- no, but really, this time they were!</p>\n\n<p>And so, we can learn from Sociology what steps to take in order to counteract random, but risky, network phenomena\n-- because nobody likes to go for a swim at the beach, and unwittingly get shipped out to sea!</p>\n\n<p class=\"footnotes\">1.

          "post": "\n  <p class=\"firstparagraph\">There was once a time for App Developers that our habits followed our inner-philosophers--as an Esteemed Order of\nCoders--we held ourselves in the highest regard to separate form from function, and style from structural design.\nHence, in the early 2000&#39;s, a tri-partite, sensible world guided every web coder to abide by The scaffolding\nof HTML, functionality of JavaScript, and styling of CSS. A decade later, we must throw out this antiquated division\nof labor within web coding.</p>\n\n<p>Library modularization, (think JQuery, JSX, Bootstrap, etc.) within Javascript ES16 reveals that modules and components\nMust hold together CSS/HTML/JS, part by part. So, if a decade ago three teams handled html, js, css, it is now requisite\nto divide up 3 teams to 3 components (a team for the carousel widget, a team for the navigation widgets, and\n<i>\neach</i> of these component teams\n<strong>must</strong> be maintained together, not separately, the module&#39;s required html, js, css.</p>\n\n<p>This means that the new Division of Labour can no longer follow past patterns from 5 years ago. Otherwise, any and\nall coding will necessarily begin to &#39;reinvent the wheel.&#39; This is because any module, any library you go\nto, will\n<i>already</i> have its HTML pre-configured, JS pre-configured, CSS pre-configured. Thus, attempts to extricate new\ncss from one module to another (or worse yet, sharing css of modules), will only invite eventual misery, almost\ninstantly setting booby traps for the next coders upon arrival.</p>\n\n<p>So, where is the creativity? Where is the originality then? It is not gone. It has evolved to a higher level of abstraction,\nleaving to automation the boring stuff. So, if Vanilla JS is considered malpractice in the modern world, and if\nad-hoc JQuery is mocked and scoffed at by React coders, then where is creativity? If yesterday&#39;s craft was the\nhoisting of 15 javascript functions on each page, the New Art of modular coding is akin to a game of Tetris. Part\nby part, module by module, the modern coder open-source window-browses and window-shops; goes home, and cuts and\npastes, and folds and clips, then assembles and hangs to dry. Do Python programmers rewrite each particular module\ndefinition? That&#39;s absurd. Equally absurd is the javascript programmer that rewrites from scratch their modules.</p>\n\n<p>The esteemed Order of JavaScript Coders must wake up, and regain its work-load balance in this new age--an age that\neach year since 2014, the JavaScript language is rewritten, each year now, in both syntactic sugar and also fundamental\nstructure--especially the importing and exporting of modules. Therefore, philosophical Honor behooves each of us\nto a higher complexity, and a new commitment to, the &quot;Separation of Concerns.&quot; We can allow ourselves\na break, thankful for Progress, a progress by which we must\n<i>Stand on the Shoulders of Giants</i>, and Code-Create!</p>\n  ",
