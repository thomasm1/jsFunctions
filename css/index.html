April 23 Implementation of the FCC Net Neutrality Laws: <br />The Coming Battle of States' versus Federal Rights
</h6>
<p class="firstparagraph">Net Neutrality Rules, potentially one of the more important set of Individual Rights for us as citizens in the tech age, will soon undergo the rule changes voted by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) this past December. In a nutshell, the Internet Service Providers (ISP's), e.g. Comcast, Cox are granted the power--as a Title I "information service"--to slow down traffic, make fast- &amp; slow-lanes. Of course this is bad news for internet-users because even premium users may experience "throttling" if using the ISP's preferred apps.
The only stipulation holds that the ISP's rules are made public.  However, 21 states are bringing lawsuits to fight these changes, and the first assertion of State Law by Washington State today: </p>
<p class="quote">The FCC is already embroiled in a variety of lawsuits related to its rollback of net neutrality rules, including an effort from 21 state attorneys general to get a court to block the FCC's move.
</p><p class="quote">
"This is symbolic politics, because the states know it is illegal to do," Roslyn Layton, a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, told NBC News. "But they can put rules on the book and make it look like they're doing something."

The FCC is already embroiled in a variety of lawsuits related to its rollback of net neutrality rules, 
including an effort from 21 state attorneys general to get a court to block the FCC's move<sup>1</sup>.

<p>
The big question arises over <i>who</i> has jurisdiction between the States' and Federal authority; yet one thing is certain, the coming battle for protecting citizens' rights will take place over jurisdiction of Internet Bandwidth turf.
