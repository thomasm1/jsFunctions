	<br /> How does one measure a Cat's inspiration to go outside and excercise? And, how does one evaluate the brawn of
	Tigers and Lions' depth or fragility of modeling effort? Here at KCBB Cat Fashion and Technology Evaluators,
	our professional research efforts center on the methodology of Cat-Human Metrics and Sharing of Technology toward
	the Greater Cat-Cause</p>
	<p> As always, the Halifax SPCA shall co-facilitate the 10% Pre- or Post-Tax Automatic Donation to Continental SPCAs
	and Cat-Parks (Including Sphere-Racing and Tower-Climbing-Races for which 2014 marked the first race up the Dubai
	Towers, whose entire height served 9 cat racers, outfitted with velco-claws and the ten-lane Wall-Strip).</p>
	<p>
	We at the Kitten-Catten-Bling-Bling Club also recognize there are no places of work or business, except in certain regions,
	and so each of our franchised locations cater to culturally-competent cat needs, likes, and most of all, delicacies
	of the wider Cat Kingdoms that are demanded of our services. Each day we aim to prove TMM's eternal passion for
	serving the Cats and Cat-Households in the vastness of the NorthWestern Continent. </p>

	January 29
	<br />
	<br/>Toronto, Ontario
	<br />
	<br /> I at first turned down two initial offers to participate as a translator on account of the commitment and the
	danger. Set in a cushy weekly piece that kept my free time at bay, I hardly had thoughts of flying to Toronto
	for 4 nights. But my calling as a Citizen of the World called me North. Let us say that I felt compelled because
	I learned the many dialects of Feline from an encounter in my youth. As a boy of perhaps a few years, our Parisian
	family house-sat at the English neighbors, friends of Papan. Of course, they had a cat that aroused the surest
	of curiosities like my own. Needless to say, in a brief moment of time after pulling the cat's tail--just in
	that very moment did we agree that he would spare but for one scar, a light, invisible "C" on my cheek. Only
	I knew and those I showed this light, yet lasting scar. The cat showed mercy to me in that moment and thus--in
	the briefest of milliseconds of time I agreed to act as Protector of all cats among all kingdoms and across the
	Species. The years passed until the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve, Two-Thousand sixteen. At the stroke
	of midnight, my scar disappeared from sight as clearly as the sun separates from the sky on the moonless, eclipsed
	night. That night I knew my calling was sent and so I made the appropriate arrangements to attend the conference,
	in the role and limited capacities as a UN-protected general bystander, apprentice-journalist, and part-time
	historiographer. My knowledge of four languages proved vital for my attendance. I know two dialects of SCS (Southern
	Cat Syndicate), which is enough for other translators to fill in the gaps into other dialects. I also know human
	javaScript, R, and XML. These shall serve the cats for the exponential growth of Cat scratchlets, and any collar-maget
	reading and communication devices. Household Cat-scratchlet usage entirely bypassed the traditional personal
	cat padlet, with the Yarn-ball and Yarn-pad and immediately picked up with the Walkie-Talkies and Collar-phones.
	It is for these reasons, I surmise, that a new Cold War in Cat Fashion may be near to erupt. According to reports,
	one semi-truck was smuggled with Fancy-Feast Cans, and some say a small drone was operated. Therefore, the demand
	for more Human-Computer languages, cultures, and most of all fashionable accessories.
	<br />
	<br /> According to most accounts, I collected through interviews, the human-computer-technology swaps from underground
	manufacturing firms in the north are replete with the finest and most expensive Cat products and even palatial
	homes-- vacant of human owners, except on paper. I found there are underground knitting and yarn cooperatives
	that span miles in all directions--at the depth of at times 1,500 feet. Two Cat-Friendly sky-scrapers were recently
	purchased by anonymous donors, under obvious pseudonyms as "Mr Smith the Brother of Miss Jen's sister's half-nephew-in-law"--clearly
	the syntax of Cats! It was clearly a curiosity of wealth for the cats and I was very happy for these friendly,
	rambunctious animals of the Highest Order. And so this recent curiosity placed the the truth in my possession,
	and so with respect for all Human Friends of Cats across the species, these details have not been spared. And
	yet, I must confess my account of this narrative in English is due in fact that my business partner and Co-Proprietor
	of TMSquare.net, Mr. Winslow from Chicago, only reads English. Be it known that our agreement of my 50.9% and
	Winslow's 49.1% means two different percentages. Although in truth Human math rounds up by the decimal point
	to my 51% ownership, the mathemecat axia define that in binary situations, i.e. logistic regressions, such as
	the TCat-Winslow divide, my 50.9% rounds down to 50% and thus in all cat kingdoms, Winslow is recognized as Fully
	One-Half Owner as clear as 50%/50%. I happen to know that mathematica only uses integers, but I certainly don't
	want to insult my business partner. After all, it seems to be Winslow that holds all the cards each time I read
	the news. For Cat Eyes Only. log-journal- Blog on the Greater Cat Kingdoms Papparrazi-shots devalue with the
	dissemination of selfies thus making the the private life easy, and therefore a photo on the Night in Toronto
	calling rumours over a recent Cat-Human Tri-Partite Continental Conference. Most obviously, for the exchange
	of cat freedoms, protections, and more public cat funding for peace, and also Feline technology-sharing agreements.
	<br />
	<br />These rumours are most assuredly true. The parties involved included the Southwestern Cat-Syndicate--which introduces
	the second economy (80% of underground cats and Alley-cats between LA and BC) currently under the direction of
	the crime boss "Don Leonzo" (grey Tabby, 8 years)--with the Middle-Region Canadian Cats (MRCC), and by conference
	call, NACK (Northern Alliance Cat Kingdom--a kingdom holding more underground wealth in little Halifax, Canada
	than Los Angeles and Chicago combined). I acted as Cat-Human translator under the contractual agreement with
	the MRCC, NACK, and the SCS. All parties agreed on the CN Tower, 10:30 p.m., Table A1, in Toronto as the most
	neutral location. No jumping out of the agreement at the last minute--even for the bravest of cats. The unnamed
	Human Lobbyists and Representatives from various nations, though mostly francophone nations, France, Canada,
	Quebec, Great Britain, Germany, Russia and Israel, among other nations. One representative from Kellog (only
	private Lobbyist). I come before you in full disclosure and with open agreements of both the humans and cats,
	that in exchange for my translating services, I accept, as co-proprietor and representative of TMM (pronounced
	TMSquare), the unanimous nomination and sponsorship by the Certification and Knighting as Official Member of
	the Distinguished KCBB club. (Kitten-Cat-Bling-Bling club--one of only eight other living humans.) Therefore,
	I assure you, fellow stock-holders that the future of TMSquare is bright. The second pronouncement is that the
	secret TMM co-proprietor's identity is none other than Winslow, the brother of Casper, now living in Seattle,
	Washington. Thomas Milton owns 50.9% and Winslow 49.1%. I ensure the Board that Cat-Human company ownship is
	now recognized by 38 mostly first-world countries

	<br />
	
	<p class="p">
	
			January 29
			<br />
			<br/>Bellingham, Washington
			<br />
			<br /> Contrary to most understanding, the Middle Region Canadian Cats (MRCC) hail from their territorial provenances
			in the West.
			<br />According to the revered geographer and cultural mystic, i.e., Casper the brother of Winslow (brother by
			pedigree and caretakers, yet brothers hetero-litter--(As Winslow once coined it)--the same from brother Casper,
			Alliegiance intrinsic to the praiseworthy Feline Species, as custom would have it, derives from --1.(Very
			often at the address of the human caretakers), and of course, "CW", or as some refer of the Higher Power
			of all Cats, The "Collective Whim".
			<br />
			<br />Casper, in the musings of his street days, first pawed the now fashionable custom of the cats: At the sight
			of food, look up and pay mind to Cat King, Cat Kin, and Cat Kind! Casper's other
			<i>cat fad</i> from many seasons ago, was his battle cry first learned upon the near-capture by a traveling
			band of ill-minded motorized humans--with the shrill that shattered each tempered pane among the motorized
			caravan--Winslow shrieked, Give me my Whim or Give me my next life! What a sight it was, I'm told. The ill-intentioning
			caravaners tried to capture Casper, Cas vanished before the last pain fell to the iced highway. Cas' greatest
			yet contribution was a careful outlining of the MRCC and their regions.
			<br />
			<br /> There are two reasons as outlined by the charter--first known as the
	
			<i>Continental Cat Understanding</i>, that along with what is now the Northern Alliance, they should to fight
			for better trade--whether for the livery trading of fish, new yarn, and other staples unavailable in the
			hinterland.
			<br />
			<br /> These, according to Cas, separated from the Southern Cat Syndicate around the time when the notorious Don
			Leon was a mere yeungling kitten, yet oblivious to the massive fortuned empire amassed by the lineage of
			his mother care-taker, Leona.
			<br />
			<br /> Very little is known of this rich lore. Leon, once grown to a strong stature, continued in the same vein
			of
	
			<i>territorializing</i>--the silent cats's call--over the course of eight seasons, through networks of allies.
			<br />
			<br />Troubling as it appeared, this began to irreversably sidetrack the peace of the cat trade--fancy feast cans
			quintrupled in cost--forget the new yarn!! The street and domestic dealings of fish narrowed and great apprehension
			grew in the land. This of course fractured much trade into the second cat economy, leading to many misunderstandings.
			The Jaguars of the north became convinced of this solution-- what was then named the Coastal Underground
			Economy. Thus, the riches from the Halibut, as much as from the common yarnlet trickets, grew even more sparse.
	
			<i>Topsy-Turvy Inteet!!!</i> as Cas would love to meow. Hunger, as any cat would reason, devalues any economy.
			Thus, for a long period of seven times the four seasons, there were so few affordable delicacies for those
			not willing to parlay. Fancy Feast deprivation, from the cold, grey sky over the November beaches of the
			West to the parched, heated piercing sky over the jungles of the East. One may say, they were dire days--or,
			so it is according to my source--for I, as human, can only repeat what is reported to me, which is my Oath
			of Herodotus, per my Historiographical Contract to recount the daily lives that most fashionably shapes cat
			lives across all kingdoms.

					<br /> Why Wait, Winslow? Right? Bat at your scratchlet and, Write! ...seered the Oracle of Halifax to W upon
					his arrival to the 9-week retreat. Near the time period that W's attorneys began discovery proceedings,
					W decided upon the north for direction. Since the age of the passage of the Lacey Act, the Western seas'
					wildlife protection statutes have only emboldened the international traffickers, while all cats have
					suffered needlessly at the hands of U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service--the Death Star of the seas for what
					concerns all continental cats. Certain fish of the most peculiar and extraordinary of tastes--suddenly
					and de jure outlawed--spawned a new black market entirely devoted to fish. Months passed, and a return
					to normalcy meant one thing only: The long, crushing suffering of Winslow's unwilling abstinence should
					come to an end.
					<br />
					<br />W's love affair with Yellowtail amberjack Seriola lalandi would be restored. Tasty treats like these
					must never be heated above 1&deg; celsius (or in cat knowledge, 90 seconds out of ice--which is a rare
					fish whose purity of taste should trump play-time) Winslow is a cat of extreme tastes, and each night
					he lit a candle for the separation--or at least, so I was told by W his self. The finest catch, so rare,
					so delicate, it was said that one tongue-lash, and any cat could be enamoured, so that the expanse of
					the seas should be searched without avail for an equally sublime flavor. According to Winslow, all market
					machinations returned to normalcy--under the table--and yet, all in the shadows of the alley for certain
					fish. This was so until the onset of "Operation Crush"--an effort led by, again, USFW drawing the ire
					of all Western cats, especially those most hurt by the operation. My concern is that no-one mentioned
					of any change or new action on fish protectinos at the Tri-Partite Conference, involving cooperation
					of Northern Alliance Cat Kingdom, Middle-Region Canadian Cats, and the Southwestern Cat Syndicate. There
					are major problems that have my worst fears racing: If lawlessness breaks out again between regions,
					the digital fashion trade, the electronics and technology sharing, legitimate trade--All at Risk!

					<br /> Re: Re: Re: Re:Lost data &amp; Wrongful arrest of Winslow at Pike Place Fish Market Smuggling-Bust </p>
	
			<p class="p"> Bellingham, Washington
					<br />
					<br /> They say the algorithm serves for the rocket-head, and the data provide the rocket fuel. Therefore,
					my valued cat investors, whiskered friends, and feline colleagues that have gathered here tonight: I
					tell you this evening that no worthwhile failed attempts should be without the same grande spectactale
					as the successful liftoffs -- thus we can look with equanimity whether our rocket fuel is spilled in
					a static explosion of might and awe for the wider feline world to behold, even atop the launchpad. Or,
					and more preferably as intended--along a burning trail that traces to the skies above!
					<br />
					<br /> The facts are that some data were "spilled" over the weekend, and indeed the fireball was bright. Furthermore,
					the facts of Winslow's arrest, stolen scratchlet and stolen data reveal a different set of facts according
					to my view. We should wait and rejoice for the billowing and blackening smoke, and the flames as they
					yet smolder even through this night. In the name of progress we took our risk and in the name of progress
					we take our reward!
					<br />
					<br /> I can assure you that Winslow's arrest, bond-hearing, and upcoming litigation will by no paw interfere
					with the next set of benchmarks, at least technically related. This W and I can guarantee. In fact, as
					fortune and W's mystical foresight would have it, the competition, the market-regulators, they have in
					their possession a red-herring: W's lost scratchlet carried the algorithms, as they were coded and pawed,
					and as they were 11-11-15--these were the algs used in conjunction with the data involved with the recent
					calamity. They reflect lost progress from months earlier, relating to an unused--and easily discarded--branch
					of progress. Since that time--and unrelated to any propriety tinged by the recent smoke--TMM took W's
					algs, then we created nine separate inter-dependent "t-solid rocket boosters" that provide new, dynamic
					data for everyninth of the energy-consuming(wasting), rocket-fuel data that is consumed upon the each
					ninth stage of "lift-off".
					<br />
					<br />Whether W's data and designs are implicated with the Pike Place Sting or not is simply a thing no cat
					or human will know, at least for now. The board does need to consider the upcoming dates of the MRCC's
					annual Dat-n-Cog &copy; Fashion Show, in which we cannot be found wanting. W will meet the one million
					euro bond well before this date. Nonetheless, the data spilt and the cat out of the bag, therefore, We,
					acting as governing board must act quickly--in spite of W's regretful absence--to vote for 100% Unveiling
					of the T-(9) Titanium, Turquoise, Cobalt and gold earring-bluetooth walkie-talkie--and we do have W's
					written assent and paw-print as I am now passing along. And so, I think there won't be any questions
					from media regarding W's current legal situation, or they'll be deflected given that my contact let me
					know he'll be free by the morning. However, questions will linger as to the reason for his whereabouts
					at Pike Place, and how arrested? I too, share your concern and yet technical plans must nonetheless go
					forward on the WM-Nine-SRB-Coordinator!

					<br /> It makes now, let's see, seven months since we had last heard from engineering. The surprise did not
					disappoint anyone -- as it happens, the lofty idea of assigning five separate algorithms, with each of

					<br /> Thus, for every four-processor pc out in the world: Taking the caspering cat to task, let's ask: Does
					it make more sense to assign four-hundred pounds to the one cat, and fifty pounds-each to the rest of

							<br />March 09
							<br />
							<br/>Chicago, Illinois
							<br />
							<br /> fIGHTS, FIGHTS, and more FIGHTS! It seems every single decision must be reconsidered, and nuanced,
							and then rejected all in a day's work with Winslow. Reading his msg this morning, wow: I haven't
							spoken to him in 5 months and not written with him in maybe three days and in that span of time has
							transpired: a) New debates of the spelling of MeeooW Inc. or Meeoow Inc. because Winslow can't stand
							for his name to be lower case. He is incensed over the matter still. Winslow has no idea in the world
							how the English language works, but amazingly this cat has a way with irony and sarcasm and double
							entendres, so go figure. More perplexing is Winslow's absolute disbelief in superstition--cats are
							by far the most superstitious civilization I have ever encountered. I'm not a theologian, so I don't
							pry into these matters. Well, W's solution is to invert the name to "OoWMee", or back to "OwMe" or
							rather--"Owe-Me.net"? A bit scathing for a company name. TMM has graciously provisioned us for a
							three-month runway for turning profit, and we don't even have a name yet !
							<br />
							<br />By any other business plan, my situation would virtually prophecy failure. Yet, Winslow and I agree
							on a number of ideologies, and one big item is that we both despise bourgois business models that
							must immerse itself instantly into debt, first to early-investors, then banks, then promised riches
							to share-holders.
							<br />
							<br /> We arrive there by inverting "stages", not the whole process, along the path toward maturity. Just
							like the sentence that is reversed, not by its structure but by the parts, the words. Hence, the
							structure achieves the same purpose, and yet the words are reversed, providing nuanced and better
							meaning. Thus mean-ing is ing-mean. "Preview" in the old sense is now "Viewpre" in the new meaning.
							Cat's are naturally ambi-directional, yet thankfully I read right to left thanks to Hebrew's direction.
							MMMmhhhh. I still prefer a form of w Meow.net over Owme.net.
							<br />
							<br /> Rather than being led by the cart of debt and promised profit, year after year, TMSquare grants
							us the freedom to put the cart after the cat, that we may forage forth along the path of what is
							good, what is beautiful, and what is useful (which by our non-bourgeois logic, translates into profit
							anyway). We never fear, but we do admire the cart of growing profit in our rear-view shoulder-holster
							mirrors, as somehow this enterprise gains momentum by the brawn of one cat and the logic of one man...
							so, again, Winslow, shall it be "Meow?" "Owme" (which still leaves Winslow uncapitalized, and worse
							yet is "Woem", which makes backward letters and cats are almost always very superstitious against
							this sort of reverse. Absolute taboo) or "meow" MeeoW, ..? Perhaps this may satisfy Winslow and his
							whimsical taste--a taste that may alter the digital-fashion lives of thousands of cats across the
							land.

					kingdom, Gateau's break was undoubtedly orchestrated via truckloads of Fancy Feast bribes. The official
					storyline reads an elderly woman's Used Book Boutique, adjacent to the Western entrance of the Zoo, was
					used as a front for smuggling key players in the escape. Although the book-store front regularly featured
					upwards of 8 to 10 cats in the windows and atop the books...but nobody would have guessed four-hundred
					cats passed through the front-door during the weeks preceding the Escape, spending a week in the window-sill,
					then into the tunnel system beneath, each dyad of cats forming teams, and teams incrementally populating
					key positions for the night of the second New Moon after Labor Day.
	
					<br />
					<br />The National Zoo's underground Shale geology poses a dubious security risk into play on account of the
					crumbling nature of shale. It's no wonder such an elaborate scheme would be funded by one of the world's
					richest cats. As you recall, Gateau's wealth is bested only by the infamous Don Leonzo, crime boss of
					the Southwestern Cat Syndicate. According to Casper, whose eyewitness account I do trust, the federalis
					had planned a simultaneous raid aiming to catch Gateau ordering the interception of Fancy Feast can shipments,
					along with New-Yarn and Cat-Nip cross-country, inter-state shipments. All the evidence had systematically
					disappeared during the trial, leading to a hung jury. Notwithstanding, as Casper recounts, the judge
					ruled jure banco "rule of the [judge's] bench," and thus Gateau was sent to the Capitol Zoo under the
					pseudonym "Ollie" the Bobcat.

					<br /> Not everyone knew the whereabouts of the next Cat-Human Tri-Partite Conference. Win, of course, would
					be going with his follow-up report dated from the Toronto Accords. These issues frame the basis of all
					cat freedoms, protections, and the ever-promised public cat funding in exchange for peace. As expected,
					most of the the 38 participating nations ratified an agreement on tithes. Other piece of order is the
					still lingering sanctions on the Southwestern Cat-Syndicate, i.e. the 2nd economy, catering to three
					quarters of the street-cat population, the underground cats and Alley-cats between LA and British Columbia.
					The primary economy driving the cat kingdoms originates from the Fort Knox of the north: Residing at
					Northern Alliance Cat Kingdom. According to all accounts, The wealth in little Halifax, Canada is supposed
					to originate from a 17th century storied outpost, a French one, dealing in Fur Trapping--the most famous
					of which is Waiting Whiskers Trading Post. As legend has it, the underground wealth stores were voraciously
					saved, and saved under paw and key: Beneath the sacred catacombs (Beyond which no humans would pass)
					were stored the riches. From generation to the next, each adding to the last. Under British occupation,
					it is said that history itself forgot her wealth--as nothing extant exists over that 130-period. Balance
					sheets reveal wealth transfer in one direction only--always a vacuum of disappearing sums, now revealed
					beneath the frozen tundra. I can only surmise the French heritage protected the secrets. And, of course,
					Gateau takes the cake with such famous descendants. Equally, just as these cats of the N.A.C.K. protected
					the regions by sustaining the very economy that feeds it! A marvel in the age of Big Credit &amp; Loans.

					<br /> For cat Eyes Only></For> 6. And so how did I get entangled in this feline fiasco? Well, the larger the
					cat, the longer the tale to catch ... I had placed an ad in the local cat-news tribune for minor translating
					services, for humans and also catering cats, for at least basic contracts for written works and to a
					lesser degree, oral translating meetings between two or more parties. As to the events leading to my
					precarious--and perhaps pivotal--role, pinned between the insatiable, increasingly incompatible interests
					among the Sfeline factions, all the while enriching myself through partnership with the genius Winslow,
					and to a lesser degree, the traveling geo-historiologue, Casper from Chicago himself. My knighting, nomination,
					and sponsorship by Certification as Official Member of the Distinguished KCBB club, Kitten-Cat-Bling-Bling
					club sort of sealed the deal, sealed my fame, and ultimately my fortune--all depending on the feuding
					outcomes of the power-hungry cat-kingdoms. For c*at Eyes Only </p>

					THE TALES AS THEY ARE, ARE PASSED DOWN THROUGH FAMILY LINEAGES, SOMETIMES 250 YEARS' ANCESTRY. CASPER EXPLAINS THAT TIME
					AND ESPECIALLY GENEALOGIC TIME, HOWEVER UNTRANSLATABLE FROM ANY CAT DIALECT, CAN HOWEVER BE UNDERSTOOD, HE
					CONTINUES. GENERATIONS ARE NOT MEASURED IN LITTER-SPANS AS EVERY 15 to 25 YEARS. INSTEAD, TIME IS CONSIDERED
					TEMPORO-TOPOGRAPHICAL--SO THAT IF IN ONE DEN, ONE BUILDING, THERE ARE AT THE SAME TIME MULTIPLE GENERATIONS
					FROM GRAND-GRAND-KITTEN TO GRAND-GRAND-PATER-KATTEN /-MATER-KATTEN, THEN
					<i>THAT</i> TIME SPAN, OVER HOWEVER LONG IT LASTS WHETHER 10 YEARS OR 100 YEARS, COUNTS AS
					<i>ONE</i> GENERATION. THIS IS THE TRADITION AS IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN, BUT THE DOMESTICATS - THOSE THAT URBANIZED
					- LESS FORMALLY TOPOLOGICAL. BUT DOMESTICATS ARE SO FEW PROPORTIONALLY, MAYBE BUT 2 CATS OUT OF 10 IN TRUTH
					CATCENSUS - OR SO AT LEAST RECOUNTS CASPER. </p>
			<p>THUS, THE GENEALOGIES AS RECOUNTED MAY NOT REFLECT HUMAN CHRONOGRAPHY. PETYAS, THEN A DISTANT ANCESTOR OF CASPER,
					IS ONLY SEPARATED BY 8 GENERATIONS, SINCE 1810--CALCULATED OF COURSE ACCORDING TO CASPER'S TOPOLOGICAL-CHRONOGRAPHY.
					COMPLICATED, BUT FAIRLY INTUITUIVE--SUCH A RICH, ADVANCED SOCIETY, THIS SPECIES. NOW, NINE TENTHS OF THE
					ACCOUNTS I RECOUNT ARE TOLD OR RETOLD BY THE ONE AND SINGULAR CASPER, THE BROTHER OF WINSLOW. CASPER, WITH
					SUCH A BROAD GENEALOGY AS ANY OF THE FELINES I'VE MET, CASPER HIMSELF A HISTORIOGRAPHER AND GEOGRAPHER BY
					TRADE REMAINS AN IDEAL WITNESS OF THE DAILY LIVES AND HISTORIES FROM AMONG THE CAT KINGDOMS, AND THE LORE.</p>
	
			<p>
	
					THESE HISTORIES, AND THE DOCUMENTS, WERE ONLY MADE POSSIBLE RECENTLY, AS THEY WERE UNEARTHED AT THE RESIDENCE OF ONE IMPORTANT
					FIGURE AMONG THESE DISTANT RELATIVES OF CASPER, (NOT BY BLOOD THROUGH WINSLOW'S STEP-LITTER MOTHER, MIREILLE,
					MIND YOU). MIREILLE HAILED FROM BRITISH SIDE OF THE ST. LAWRENCE WHILE CASPER'S GREAT, GREAT GRAND-AUNT,
					ANASTASIA, THE EASTERN, FRENCH SIDE. ANASTASIA--AN ABYSSINIAN--LOYALLY AIDED THE FRENCH TRADERS--THIS HAD
					BEEN A FAIR AND JUST CAPTAIN TO WIN HER FRIENDSHIP. IT IS SAID THIS UNNAMED HUMAN SHIP CAPTAIN, HAD BEEN
					KNIGHTED AMONG THE FEW LUCKY ENOUGH TO JOIN THE KCBB CLUB--i.e., KITTEN-CAT BLING BLING CLUB.
			</p>
			<p>THE TREASURE-TROVE OF DOCUMENTS BEQUEATHED TO CASPER, AS THEY HAD BEEN FOUND IN AN ABANDONED FORMER ABODE OF
					OUR LONG-AGO ANASTASIA-THE SAME WHOSE FAME PRECEDED HER FOR FEARLESS SEAFARING (THOUGH SOME MIGHT SAY SHE
					AND HER BAND WERE FREQUENT STOWAWAYS ON THE UNSUPERVISED CUTTERS AND FERRIES). THIS ACCOUNT, DATED APPROXIMATELY
					1808-1812 FROM THE JOURNALS, DIARIES, AND RECEIPTS PRESERVED, THAT CASPER PROVIDED, ALONG OF COURSE WITH
					THE ORAL TRADITION, WHICH I NOW RETELL, IN PARAPHRASE FASHION TOWARD THE TELLING OF THIS TALE.
	
			</p>
	
	
	
			<p>
	
					CASPER HIMSELF EXPLAINS THAT THE SAME ANASTASIA-THE SEAFARING ABYSSINIAN FROM MID 1800'S, HAD BEEN THE GRAND-GRAND-GRAND-KITTEN
					OF LITTER OF PETYAS--A PERSIAN OF COURSE--THAT IS THE KEY CAT IN THIS LINEAGE--PETYAS, NEPHEW OF THE PET
					FELINE OF THE SERVANT OF BONAPARTE, WAS A KITTEN BY THE NAME OF CL&Eacute;APATRICE. NO INTEREST IN HUMAN
					AFFAIRS, BUT HER FRIENDSHIP WITH THE EVER-PAWING CURIOSITY OF PETYAS LED TO HIS RECORDING, BY DOCUMENT AND
					DIARIES, OF THE TUMULTUOUS AFFAIRS SURROUNDING THE WORLD-OVERTURNING NAPOL&Eacute;ONEIC INVASION OF HIS IMPERIAL
					MAJESTY, TSAR ALEXANDRE OF THE RUSSIA. THE DIARY ACCOUNT, PEPPERED WITH USUAL KITTEN GOSSIP AND DELICACIES,
					ALSO INCLUDES A WEALTH OF CURIOSITIES. AND, CURIOUSLY, THEY TELL A DIFFERENT TALE THAN THAT ESPOUSED BY MODERN
					HISTORIANS ON THE EVENTS SURROUNDING THE MISTAKEN IMPRESSION THAT LED TO WAR AND UNTOLD DESTRUCTION. ACCORDING
					TO USUAL GHOSTWRITING METHODOLOGY, WHICH I ADAPTED TO THE CAT INTERVIEWS, I FIRST STRUCTURE WEEKLY, MONTHLY,
					YEARLY PATTERNS SO AS TO RECREATE THE PAST TO A LOGICAL SENSE--GIVEN THE CONFUSION OVER A CAT'S SENSE OF
					TIME FOR WHICH THERE ARE FEW ACCURATE COGNATE-WORTHY TRANSLATIONS--ACCORDING AS CASPER RECOUNTS. LE 8 AOUT,
					VERSAILLES, FRANCE.</p>
			<p>
	
					BY THE WINTER OF 1812, FRANCE'S HEGEMONY EXTENDS BEYOND EUROPE. BONAPARTE'S BROTHERS AND COUSINS WERE SET IN CHARGE OF SPAIN,
					PORTUGAL 'PROVINCES'. THE SOLE THREAT TO THE NAPOL&Eacute;ONE AS A MIRAGE ONLY INCREASINGLY CONVINCED NAPOL&Eacute;ONE
					OF THE IMAGINARY THREAT FORM THE EAST, FROM TSAR ALEXANDRE I. NAPOL&Eacute;ONE'S MASSIVE ARMED REGALIA, LA
					GRANDE ARMEE, ROUGHLY 200 TIMES A THOUSAND CONSCRIPTS, BY FAR OUTNUMBERED TSAR ALEXANDRE'S MINISCULE ARMED
					SOLDIERS AND TECHNOLOGY. </p>
			<p>At this point, I had to take my leave for the day, but tale unfolded much differently than expected ... </p>
	
			<p>
	
					.. and so, the topic of peace CAME UP ONE AFTERNOON WHILST CASPER AND I SAT FOR OUR SUNDAY CHECKERS MATCH THAT WE FOUND OURSELVES
					DISCUSSING THE MERITS OF PEACETIME, AND A GRATITUDE FOR THAT AS OPPOSED TO THE WORST OF TIMES. AND SO CONTINUE
					THE PATCHWORK HISTORIES OF UNSUCCESSFUL WAR CAMPAIGNS, AMONG WHICH ONE STANDS OUT FOR INTEREST. IN FACT,
					THE ORAL TRADITION OF CATS IS VERY DETAILED, WITH MANY CONCEPTS UNTRANSLATABLE, BUT IN PETYAS' RECORDINGS
					ABOUT THE EMPORER, THE PARTICULAR, SINGULAR , NAPOL&eacute;ONE. FROM CHILDHOOD, L&eacute;ONE MAINTAINED A
					CERTAIN UNEXPLAINABLE PHOBIA OF CATS OF ALL KINDS -- SO MUCH SO THAT THERE IN ORDER DAY-TIME CURFEWS--THE
					NAPOL&EacuteONIC HOURS--IN WHICH ANY SIGHT OF CATS WAS STRICTLY FORBIDDEN BY THE EMPEROR. </P>
	
	
	
			<P>NAPOL&Eacute;ONE'S RESIDENCE RARELY MAINTAINED MORE THAN A MONTH'S TIME IN PARIS, DUE MOSTLY TO THE MANY CAMPAIGNS.
					THE SERVANTS, HOWEVER, IN CHARGE OF ERECTING THE VELVET TENT WALLS FOR THE IMPERIAL WING OF THE MILITARY
					ENCAMPMENTS--THESE WERE 9 LARGE TENTS PARELLEL [IN THE LANGUAGE OF CAT SYNDICATE, THE WORD EEAUIU IMPLIES
					FOOTS SWISHING FOOTS]. AND SO THE TENTS, ARRANGED PARALLEL, TWICE OVER, WAS THE INGENIOUS SYSTEM OF MAINTAINING
					NEW CLEANING SYSTEM. THIS INVENTED ARRANGEMENT BY THE SERVANTS OF LEONE (NAPOL&Eacute;ONE'S NICKNAME AMONG
					MOST, AND IRONIC TOO!) WERE GREATLY REWARDED FOR THIS NOVEL WAY OF "AUTOMATING" THE DE-CAMPING AND EN-CAMPING
					WITH OTHER DUTIES. 12 CATS GENERALLY WERE PERMITTED WITHIN THE ENTIRE CAMP, AND ONLY THE BAKER'S TWO CATS
					PETYAS AND AMANDINE, AND THE THIRD TO THE LEAD SCOUT (HE WHOSE ROLE IS TO FIND STAKE OUT THE MOST 'LOGISTIC'
					ENCAMPMENT, ACCORDING TO TOPOLOGICAL STRATEGY. HIS CAT, CL&Eacute;APATRICE,
					<P>
	
	
	
					</P>THIS CHIEF LOGISTICS OFFICER, HENRI, HAD BEEN CREDITED MORE THAN ONCE FOR BATTLE-SAVING DECISIONS REGARDING
					LOCATION OF THE IMPERIAL MILITARY ENCAMPMENT. THEREFORE, EVERYONE KNEW CL&Eacute;APATRICE WAS THE ONLY CAT
					WITHIN SITE OF NAPOL&Eacute;ONE'S FIERCE MILITARY THAT HAD PERMISSION TO STRUT WITHOUT REPERCUSSION IN THE
					PRESENCE OF EMPEROR NAPOL&Eacute;ONE. FEW MILITARY HISTORIANS KNOW OR HAD ACCESS TO THE FULL GENIUS OF BONAPARTE,
					BECAUSE HIS TRUSTED LOGISTICS OFFICER, FREQUENTLY CONSULTED WITH AND ADVISED ON MILITARY STRATEGY--ESPECIALLY
					THAT OF TOPOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS BEFORE, DURING, AND POST-BATTLE. THE ELEMENTS OF SURPRISE, THE GEOMETRIC
					FIRING POTENTIAL, AND EVEN DRAGGING THE MUNITIONS, THE CANNON WHEELS UP AND ACROSS MUDDY HILLS. AND SO CL&Eacute;APATRICE'S
					SOCIAL PLACEMENT MEANT SHE COULD AND DID WIN MANY FAVORS FOR THE CATS OF THE ENCAMPMENT AND ALL FRENCH CATS
					ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE OF EARLY NINETEENTH CENTURY FRANCE. </P>
			<P>
	
			</p>
			<p> AND SO IT WAS, THE TSAR'S EMISSARY ARRIVED, AS EXPECTED, TO SMOLENSK ONE SEPTEMBER DAY TO SUE FOR PEACE. ACCORDING
					TO HIS IMPERIAL MAJESTY, THE TSAR ALEXANDRE, WAR SHOULD BE AVERTED AT ALL COSTS--NEGOTIATIONS ON LITHUANIA
					AND EAST POLAND CAN BE DISCUSSED LATER DIPLOMATICALLY. NOW, WHILE THE DIALOGUE CONTINUED, CL&Eacute;APATRICE
					ALSO WAS ONLY ON HAND BECAUSE HENRI WAS SENT ON THIS EMISSARY ENCAMPMENT, IN HIS CAPACITY AS SCOUT. UNBEKNOWNST
					EVER TO HENRI, NOR ESPECIALLY THE ENTIRE DIPLOMATIC-MILITARY CONTINGENT. CL&Eacute;APATRICE AND SOMETIMES
					EVEN PETYAS, WERE STOWAWAYS TO HEAR THE LATEST NEW AND DEVELOPMENTS.</P>
	
			<p>ONLY BY SMOLENSK WAS THE LAST HOPE TO SUE FOR PEACE FAILED. LOGICALLY IT WOULD ONLY MAKE SENSE TO RETURN TO FRANCE
					WITH WINTER APPROACHING AND THE LONG MARCH ACROSS LITHUANIA; FLANKED BY A FLEET IN THE NORTH SEA TRAVELING
					NORTHEAST, PAST FINLAND. BONAPARTE ASSEMBLES 13 UNITS AMD CONTINUES FOR THE LONG MARCH TO MOSCOU.

	<h2>Chapter II: Casper's Treasure-Trove</h2>
							<p>
	<p>I finally settled a date to complete our second interview with Casper and his rich lineage, yet was hindered by Casper's far-away travels as a famed geographer, at least among the Feline Species. 			And soo, Casper and I finalized our long-overdue second interview, this time with the docs. I happened to be attending the Paris Air Show, and Casper was on-hand by impersonating as service cats via the airlines. 
							</p><p>Casper prefers to pace during our interviews so we thought the long hallways of the Palace of Versailles, just 45 minutes south of Paris, would serve well. On Wednesday mornings, there are fewer tourists so we agreed on noon's break next full moon. At his request, I happily agreed, and after all, it was these within these very halls that Casper's long-ago kattnancenstry, his 4th-generation-ago aunt Anastasia and five generations further, his cousin Cl&eacute;apatrice. And so, Versailles would seem as good as any place to re-interview the young Casper Lowenbrau. 'Perhaps on the terrace' he paused. We agreed after here two months, and I on a deadline. Most importantly, we were both excited to upack and translate the treasure-trove of documents dating to the French-Canadian region (then under control of the Northern Alliance Cat Kingdom (NACK) in the 1870's). These were inherited, and sent by legal cat-courier, pre-arranged by the the attention of Casper's great-great-great-Katter-Tant   Anastasia, the long-ago sea-faring Abyssian whose forklore travels to the ST. Laurent River Fish Trade. Although Anastasia was often a stowaway on the ships, then leaving from Halifax to Cherbourg, France. There it was whose great-great-niece Cl&eacute;patrice (hetero-litter cousin), personal Chateau Cat of Louis Napoleon's wife. Again to recap, Cl&eacuteatrice befriended the only other "favored" cat in the Napoleonic empire of 1809, young Petyas. And, as fortune would have it, Petyas, too, meticulously kept notes on the Imperial family's daily affairs. A more nuanced view of the family of the French Emporer, Napol&eacuteone di Bonaparte. The light-heartened banter, the scheming, always ending in scandal - these are the affairs that so interested a young Petyas--a de facto house-scribe with a passion for pawing prints. After all, it was at his word, and his katten-tante Cl&eacute;apatrice's word, that hung all of the feline gossip across the entire French Empire. By 1809, borders stretch from the beaches of Portugal and Italy up to Kaiser Wilhem in Prussia to the north and Tsar Alexandre I to the East. It was said that his imperial favor was toward all cats, and oversaw many generous pan-feline protections.
