                <br /> Mission Statement on Sharing: Cat/Human Vision for Peace and Mutual Prosperity </strong>
            <br />

            <br /> How does one measure a Cat's inspiration to go outside and excercise? And, how does one evaluate the brawn of
            Tigers and Lions' depth or fragility of modeling effort? Here at KCBB Cat Fashion and Technology Evaluators,
            our professional research efforts center on the methodology of Cat-Human Metrics and Sharing of Technology toward
            the Greater Cat-Cause</p>
        <p> As always, the Halifax SPCA shall co-facilitate the 10% Pre- or Post-Tax Automatic Donation to Continental SPCAs
            and Cat-Parks (Including Sphere-Racing and Tower-Climbing-Races for which 2014 marked the first race up the Dubai
            Towers, whose entire height served 9 cat racers, outfitted with velco-claws and the ten-lane Wall-Strip).</p>

            We at the Kitten-Catten-Bling-Bling Club also recognize there are no places of work or business, except in certain regions,
            and so each of our franchised locations cater to culturally-competent cat needs, likes, and most of all, delicacies
            of the wider Cat Kingdoms that are demanded of our services. Each day we aim to prove TMM's eternal passion for
            serving the Cats and Cat-Households in the vastness of the NorthWestern Continent. </p>
